00:06.800 --> 00:07.480
Protect Your Majesty

00:07.680 --> 00:08.320
Protect Your Majesty

00:08.440 --> 00:08.960
Your Majesty

00:09.840 --> 00:10.400
Your Majesty

00:12.760 --> 00:13.320
Your Majesty

00:13.680 --> 00:14.200
Your Majesty

00:14.600 --> 00:15.160
Your Majesty

00:35.280 --> 00:35.840
Quack doctors

00:36.120 --> 00:36.720
They're all quacks

00:36.960 --> 00:38.120
Drag them all out and behead them

00:38.600 --> 00:39.520
General, spare us

00:39.920 --> 00:41.560
General, please spare us

00:42.120 --> 00:43.560
Your Majesty's injury has reached the internal organs

00:44.000 --> 00:46.400
Coupled with years of managing state affairs

00:46.720 --> 00:48.120
And recent continuous battles

00:48.520 --> 00:51.640
Now Your Majesty's body is exhausted

00:52.000 --> 00:54.960
We truly are powerless

00:57.120 --> 00:58.040
Forget it

01:00.640 --> 01:02.240
Don't trouble them

01:03.280 --> 01:03.720
Your Majesty

01:05.680 --> 01:06.000
Your Majesty

01:06.800 --> 01:07.720
Find someone

01:09.280 --> 01:10.960
Keep them under guard

01:12.440 --> 01:14.280
No one may contact them

01:15.560 --> 01:16.040
Yes

01:17.000 --> 01:17.640
Also

01:18.480 --> 01:19.640
From now on

01:20.480 --> 01:22.040
Without my permission

01:23.800 --> 01:24.920
Anyone

01:25.480 --> 01:27.120
May not approach the tent

01:27.640 --> 01:29.000
Within ten zhang

01:32.640 --> 01:34.120
What if the two generals come to request an audience?

01:34.560 --> 01:35.920
You say

01:37.000 --> 01:37.840
I

01:38.960 --> 01:40.600
Am exhausted from marching

01:42.040 --> 01:43.000
Everything

01:43.560 --> 01:45.120
Will be discussed upon return to court

01:46.520 --> 01:47.640
Now

01:48.320 --> 01:49.680
The central plains are settled

01:50.960 --> 01:52.440
Shilang is dead

01:53.240 --> 01:54.400
Our dynasty

01:56.040 --> 01:58.760
Has no more worries

02:00.480 --> 02:02.040
Soldiers

02:04.520 --> 02:06.920
Should go home

02:08.600 --> 02:10.560
First month of the 27th year of Longwu

02:10.840 --> 02:11.920
You issue an edict

02:12.160 --> 02:15.480
Ordering the Second Prince Sikong Xu to continue guarding Yan Bei

02:15.800 --> 02:17.960
The rest of the army returns to court

02:18.400 --> 02:20.040
When reaching the Shuoyang County area

02:20.120 --> 02:21.960
The weather became increasingly cold

02:22.320 --> 02:24.760
You had to rest temporarily in Yiyang City

02:35.160 --> 02:35.600
Your Majesty

02:36.800 --> 02:37.560
The weather is too cold

02:38.160 --> 02:38.920
Not suitable for long outings

02:40.000 --> 02:40.960
Your health is important

02:42.240 --> 02:43.560
Have they all arrived?

02:44.200 --> 02:44.680
Yes

02:45.680 --> 02:46.640
The people you wish to summon

02:47.040 --> 02:48.320
Are all in the city awaiting your order

02:50.240 --> 02:51.080
Good

02:51.640 --> 02:52.520
Good

02:55.120 --> 02:56.480
At this time, the city lord's residence

02:56.800 --> 02:59.280
Has been converted into your temporary residence

03:00.120 --> 03:03.040
All your affairs are managed here

03:04.160 --> 03:05.240
Years of warfare

03:05.520 --> 03:09.000
Your hair has actually shown some silver

03:10.640 --> 03:12.040
Though physically weak

03:12.320 --> 03:15.520
Your eyes still shine with light

03:17.760 --> 03:19.840
You know your time is running out

03:20.320 --> 03:22.200
But the newly pacified realm

03:22.440 --> 03:24.520
Cannot fall into chaos again because of your departure

03:25.640 --> 03:29.680
You must handle everything that follows

03:38.720 --> 03:39.240
Your Majesty

03:55.560 --> 03:56.600
Issue orders
