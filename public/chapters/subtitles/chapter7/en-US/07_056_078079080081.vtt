00:02.600 --> 00:04.320
The will was sent back to the capital

00:04.920 --> 00:07.320
The Second Prince Sikong Xu successfully ascended the throne

00:07.680 --> 00:09.960
And changed the era name to Daxing the following year

00:10.360 --> 00:12.480
Posthumously titled the late Emperor Sikong Yao as Wen

00:12.720 --> 00:13.480
Historically known as

00:13.880 --> 00:15.240
Emperor Xuanwen

01:12.360 --> 01:13.360
Your Majesty has arrived

01:13.960 --> 01:15.280
The Emperor has come to our place

01:15.360 --> 01:16.160
Your Majesty

01:19.920 --> 01:22.200
Long live Your Majesty

01:22.920 --> 01:24.400
Fellow villagers, rise quickly

01:26.760 --> 01:27.920
Thank you, Your Majesty

01:28.360 --> 01:30.360
Thank you, Your Majesty

01:31.360 --> 01:31.880
Xunyang

01:33.080 --> 01:35.360
Why did you bring me here?

01:37.560 --> 01:39.160
Some time ago I passed through here

01:39.880 --> 01:41.080
And heard about their situation

01:42.080 --> 01:42.600
That's why I thought

01:44.400 --> 01:45.800
Your Majesty should come and see

01:50.360 --> 01:54.480
Is there not a single young person in this village?

01:57.360 --> 01:58.480
Men of military age

01:58.920 --> 02:01.200
Have all gone to the border to guard the frontier for Your Majesty

02:01.880 --> 02:03.240
Since Your Majesty ascended the throne

02:03.720 --> 02:05.880
You've fought so fiercely that enemies tremble at the news

02:06.360 --> 02:09.080
We can finally stand tall

02:09.960 --> 02:11.960
Is that so

02:12.920 --> 02:13.960
When Your Majesty goes north again

02:14.600 --> 02:17.360
Our village will surely produce another commander of a thousand

02:20.280 --> 02:20.960
My three sons

02:21.520 --> 02:23.080
All grew up hearing the late Emperor's stories

02:23.760 --> 02:25.280
To guard the nation's gates with Your Majesty

02:25.600 --> 02:26.800
Brings honor to our ancestors

02:28.360 --> 02:29.760
They all served in the same camp

02:30.920 --> 02:33.040
All entered the same camp

02:34.240 --> 02:35.520
All made contributions to Great Xuan

02:37.320 --> 02:37.720
Your Majesty

02:38.160 --> 02:39.000
My eldest son Dago

02:39.320 --> 02:40.600
Was a vanguard for General Zhu

02:41.240 --> 02:43.080
General Zhu personally buried him

02:45.400 --> 02:47.880
My eldest and second sons both died in battle beyond the pass

02:48.320 --> 02:49.120
Not a single coward

02:51.640 --> 02:52.800
Fellow villagers, you've worked hard

02:54.360 --> 02:57.480
You've worked hard

03:02.120 --> 03:03.600
Xuan Kingdom's people love Your Majesty

03:04.640 --> 03:06.240
This is just an ordinary village

03:07.160 --> 03:08.480
But precisely because it's nothing special

03:09.520 --> 03:13.040
I think one can see the whole from a part

03:14.280 --> 03:15.720
See the whole from a part

03:19.560 --> 03:20.880
Is every village like this?

03:23.400 --> 03:29.440
All filled with lonely elderly, disabled, women and children

03:31.640 --> 03:37.280
According to state law, men receive land at twenty, farm for three years

03:38.400 --> 03:39.720
Try to leave descendants

03:41.400 --> 03:46.600
At twenty-three, they should enter the army and serve the state

03:47.600 --> 03:51.760
Father once said he hoped I would become a hegemon

03:52.920 --> 03:53.400
So I thought

03:55.560 --> 03:56.960
I want to do better than elder brother

03:58.120 --> 03:59.440
To support the people

04:00.320 --> 04:01.600
Lift up the backs of our Xuan people

04:03.040 --> 04:03.560
Xunyang

04:05.920 --> 04:07.040
What do you think of these years

04:08.320 --> 04:11.480
Have I done right or wrong?

04:12.600 --> 04:18.600
Your Majesty has never failed the people or Father

04:24.000 --> 04:26.080
In the past, elder brother repeatedly advised me

04:27.040 --> 04:28.440
I turned a deaf ear

04:29.160 --> 04:32.000
Today Xunyang, you tricked me into coming here

04:32.640 --> 04:33.960
And I've awakened from a great dream

04:37.760 --> 04:42.640
I should stop

04:43.440 --> 04:45.400
Your Majesty
