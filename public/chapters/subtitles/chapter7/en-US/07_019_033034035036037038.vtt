00:00.800 --> 00:01.400
Report

00:04.160 --> 00:04.600
Have they arrived?

00:05.120 --> 00:05.400
Yes

00:08.880 --> 00:09.840
Good

00:10.400 --> 00:10.920
Good

00:27.720 --> 00:29.080
Murong Cui of Yan Dong

00:29.400 --> 00:30.680
By order of Princess Xunyang

00:31.200 --> 00:32.120
Come to reinforce

00:32.440 --> 00:32.880
Men

00:33.400 --> 00:35.640
Follow me and kill

00:35.960 --> 00:38.480
Kill

00:39.240 --> 00:40.320
Your daughter bids farewell

00:41.800 --> 00:42.840
May Father Emperor

00:43.600 --> 00:45.720
Take care of your sacred body

01:00.320 --> 01:02.880
With the reinforcement of Yan Dong Murong's cavalry

01:03.320 --> 01:05.840
Shilang's army's morale plummeted

01:06.160 --> 01:07.640
Even began to have internal conflicts

01:08.120 --> 01:10.400
Some trampled, some surrendered

01:10.680 --> 01:11.960
Some jumped off cliffs

01:12.400 --> 01:15.680
The entire army was in a state of chaos

01:38.920 --> 01:39.200
My King

01:39.960 --> 01:42.120
A Yan Dong cavalry suddenly appeared behind our army

01:42.200 --> 01:44.240
The rear army is now close to collapse

01:45.960 --> 01:47.520
My King, I'm afraid we

01:47.640 --> 01:48.200
Cannot escape

01:50.000 --> 01:51.560
It's all because of that Xuan Kingdom emperor

01:52.080 --> 01:54.120
That got us into this situation

01:55.320 --> 01:56.440
At this point

01:56.720 --> 01:58.360
Only this last plan remains

01:59.040 --> 02:00.040
This plan

02:00.240 --> 02:01.960
He taught it to me

02:05.560 --> 02:06.680
Your Majesty, something's wrong

02:07.160 --> 02:09.920
A cavalry unit from the enemy formation is charging toward our central camp

02:11.680 --> 02:12.160
What?

02:21.120 --> 02:21.960
Clear the way

02:31.280 --> 02:31.640
Your Majesty

02:32.040 --> 02:32.720
The situation is critical

02:33.160 --> 02:33.920
Please move to safety
