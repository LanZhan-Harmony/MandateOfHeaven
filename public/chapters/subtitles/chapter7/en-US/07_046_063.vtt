00:08.520 --> 00:09.200
Chu Meng

00:10.600 --> 00:11.680
Call the second son

00:15.920 --> 00:17.520
Father clearly said this wound was almost healed

00:18.280 --> 00:19.760
How is this, this

00:20.520 --> 00:23.080
Should I let everyone know my condition

00:24.000 --> 00:25.120
And cause chaos?

00:26.760 --> 00:27.600
Second son

00:28.440 --> 00:29.840
These years

00:30.160 --> 00:32.480
You've risked your life for Xuan Kingdom

00:34.080 --> 00:35.280
I can see

00:39.120 --> 00:40.440
This position

00:41.720 --> 00:43.000
To give to the eldest

00:43.440 --> 00:45.680
He might become a ruler who maintains what's achieved

00:51.080 --> 00:52.920
But will never become a hegemon

00:54.120 --> 00:57.040
In court, you have your maternal family

00:57.600 --> 01:01.560
Your mother will make the Chen family submit for you

01:03.360 --> 01:07.120
Now with General Zhu commanding all the armies

01:09.480 --> 01:11.480
Only with you as ruler

01:11.880 --> 01:13.760
Can he truly trust and follow

01:15.480 --> 01:18.040
In the future, ruler and minister will be in harmony

01:18.640 --> 01:20.080
Supporting each other

01:21.400 --> 01:22.040
Father

01:22.760 --> 01:24.640
But second son

01:25.120 --> 01:27.560
The eldest has been Crown Prince for so many years

01:27.920 --> 01:29.040
Working hard

01:31.120 --> 01:32.640
For me to decide this way

01:34.480 --> 01:35.960
I'm sorry to him

01:38.040 --> 01:40.360
And even more sorry to his mother

01:44.560 --> 01:45.440
Father above

01:45.960 --> 01:47.160
Heaven and earth as witness

01:47.520 --> 01:50.200
If I, Sikong Xu, ever turn against my own family

01:50.680 --> 01:51.840
May heaven strike me down

01:55.840 --> 01:56.840
Rise
