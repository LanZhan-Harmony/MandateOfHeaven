00:00.880 --> 00:01.640
Defend

00:02.560 --> 00:03.560
Why defend?

00:05.160 --> 00:06.680
I have let the people rest

00:07.080 --> 00:09.040
And prepared for war for decades

00:10.160 --> 00:11.560
Reformed ancestral institutions

00:12.200 --> 00:13.200
All along

00:14.520 --> 00:16.080
Countless people have been sacrificed

00:16.680 --> 00:17.520
All of this

00:18.000 --> 00:20.160
Was never for the word "defend"

00:22.920 --> 00:24.320
The situation has changed

00:25.560 --> 00:26.160
I will do

00:28.000 --> 00:29.160
What Wuzhao cannot imagine

00:30.560 --> 00:31.800
And dare not think

00:33.080 --> 00:33.760
I will

00:35.040 --> 00:36.520
Personally lead the central army

00:38.040 --> 00:39.320
To face Shilang

00:40.040 --> 00:41.160
Your Majesty must not

00:41.400 --> 00:41.920
Your Majesty, Your Majesty

00:42.160 --> 00:43.400
How can Your Majesty go to such a dangerous place?

00:43.400 --> 00:44.400
Your servant concurs

00:45.080 --> 00:47.000
If the battle situation changes

00:47.280 --> 00:50.280
How should we respond?

00:51.080 --> 00:54.040
Your Majesty, please reconsider

00:54.400 --> 00:55.000
Enough

00:57.920 --> 00:58.920
The people of the north

00:59.880 --> 01:01.400
They have waited long enough

01:02.320 --> 01:04.080
This is not about wanting to do it

01:04.800 --> 01:06.080
Or being able to do it

01:06.800 --> 01:10.080
But that the divine land must be unified
