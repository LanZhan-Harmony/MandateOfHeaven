00:07.120 --> 00:08.120
Chu Meng

00:09.040 --> 00:10.440
Call the eldest son

00:16.640 --> 00:19.520
Father, why did you urgently summon me?

00:20.520 --> 00:21.240
Come

00:23.600 --> 00:24.160
Come

00:30.280 --> 00:32.000
My body

00:32.880 --> 00:34.600
Is getting worse day by day

00:34.920 --> 00:37.120
Father, what are you saying?

00:37.720 --> 00:38.720
Do you remember

00:40.080 --> 00:41.880
When I fought back to the capital

00:42.720 --> 00:44.680
The first time you called me father

00:45.920 --> 00:47.440
What did I promise you?

00:51.280 --> 00:52.640
I said

00:52.960 --> 00:55.240
To make you the king of the entire realm

01:07.080 --> 01:08.680
This, take it

01:15.760 --> 01:17.360
Father, this

01:21.400 --> 01:22.200
Rise

01:24.960 --> 01:26.520
You've managed court affairs for many years

01:26.880 --> 01:28.240
I'll entrust Xuan Kingdom to you

01:29.120 --> 01:30.080
I'm at ease

01:30.680 --> 01:31.800
Your mother

01:32.640 --> 01:33.880
Can also rest in peace

01:34.680 --> 01:35.400
But

01:37.400 --> 01:38.760
I have one thing

01:39.480 --> 01:41.160
I need your promise

01:43.400 --> 01:44.600
If Father commands

01:44.880 --> 01:45.920
Your son will obey

01:46.400 --> 01:47.880
Your second brother is impulsive

01:48.880 --> 01:49.840
But

01:50.640 --> 01:52.320
He values family and state

01:52.880 --> 01:54.080
Values loyalty and righteousness

01:54.960 --> 01:55.960
Now in the army

01:56.520 --> 01:58.400
Grand General Zu Yue is in command

01:59.240 --> 02:01.080
The Second Prince is not your enemy

02:01.880 --> 02:04.280
He is your support, understand?

02:08.080 --> 02:09.400
In my lifetime

02:10.680 --> 02:13.440
I've done many things that can only be kept in my heart

02:16.400 --> 02:19.280
Loyal ministers and good generals, I've sacrificed

02:21.280 --> 02:23.240
Brothers

02:24.440 --> 02:26.120
I've also raised my sword against

02:29.320 --> 02:32.720
Even though we drove out Wuzhao and recovered Great Xuan

02:33.480 --> 02:34.600
Such things

02:35.000 --> 02:37.040
How can merits and faults cancel each other out?

02:38.680 --> 02:39.360
Father

02:40.000 --> 02:40.600
Sheng'er

02:45.800 --> 02:47.240
I want all of this

02:48.240 --> 02:50.080
To end with me

02:51.760 --> 02:53.160
Our Sikong family

02:54.080 --> 02:56.640
Must not shed Sikong blood again

03:04.160 --> 03:06.280
I want you to lead the people

03:07.040 --> 03:08.240
Into a golden age

03:08.920 --> 03:11.840
To be a perfect and wise ruler

03:14.480 --> 03:15.800
Your son

03:16.640 --> 03:18.760
Will not fail Father's trust

03:31.440 --> 03:32.360
Rise

03:37.400 --> 03:38.360
Good son
