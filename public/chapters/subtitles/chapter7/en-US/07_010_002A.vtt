00:00.280 --> 00:01.120
The realm

00:02.240 --> 00:03.800
Must not perish at my hands

00:06.240 --> 00:07.560
Retreat to Tianhe

00:10.840 --> 00:12.280
As Your Majesty commands

00:13.040 --> 00:15.120
Autumn of the 26th year of Longwu

00:15.280 --> 00:17.920
Under the strong pressure of Shilang's army

00:18.160 --> 00:21.880
Xuan Kingdom had to abandon Beiyu Pass and other lands north of the river

00:21.880 --> 00:25.440
And retreated to defend Tianhe, relying on the navy

00:26.120 --> 00:29.120
Shilang fought at Tianhe for half a year

00:29.320 --> 00:31.520
But could never advance a single step

00:31.760 --> 00:34.240
Finally had to retreat north

00:35.040 --> 00:38.360
Xuan Kingdom also suffered heavy losses in this battle

00:39.240 --> 00:40.520
The loss of Beiyu Pass

00:40.720 --> 00:43.760
Signaled that Xuan Kingdom had no hope of northern expeditions

00:43.760 --> 00:43.800
Signaled that Xuan Kingdom had no hope of northern expeditions
