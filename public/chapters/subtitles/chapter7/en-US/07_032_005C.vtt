00:02.440 --> 00:03.400
Someone

00:04.960 --> 00:07.440
Bring me a jar of wine

00:14.960 --> 00:16.480
They say candlelight is spiritual

00:17.560 --> 00:18.720
Now

00:19.840 --> 00:21.200
I cannot return

00:21.960 --> 00:23.880
Can only hope you'll move a few steps

00:27.320 --> 00:28.560
The war is over

00:30.880 --> 00:32.040
What I should do

00:33.440 --> 00:34.680
Is all done

00:37.920 --> 00:40.920
I've accumulated quite a few complaints to tell you

00:47.800 --> 00:48.560
Ruolan

00:51.960 --> 00:53.280
I'll see you soon

01:15.720 --> 01:16.640
Your Highness

01:17.640 --> 01:19.160
Why are you staring at me?

01:24.880 --> 01:28.360
Playing the hero, playing the hero, drinking even when injured

01:33.560 --> 01:35.360
Let me see how badly you're hurt

01:36.160 --> 01:36.760
It hurts

01:37.440 --> 01:38.360
It really hurts

01:54.640 --> 01:55.280
Your Highness

01:56.960 --> 01:57.880
I'm sorry

01:58.880 --> 02:01.360
If only I had been by your side then
