WEBVTT

00:05.400 --> 00:05.760
Your Majesty

00:07.400 --> 00:08.200
Why have you come here?

00:09.360 --> 00:09.920
Rise

00:13.320 --> 00:13.800
Your Majesty

00:14.360 --> 00:15.280
You shouldn't move around

00:15.640 --> 00:16.480
It's cold now

00:17.160 --> 00:18.720
When the weather warms up later

00:19.040 --> 00:20.160
I'll take you for a good walk

00:21.040 --> 00:21.560
What

00:24.760 --> 00:27.520
Is there something wrong with my body?

00:28.320 --> 00:28.680
Your Majesty

00:29.600 --> 00:30.760
Of course there's nothing wrong with Your Majesty's body

00:34.480 --> 00:35.240
You then

01:00.720 --> 01:01.280
Take a team

01:01.520 --> 01:01.920
With me

01:02.120 --> 01:02.640
Following behind Your Majesty

01:36.760 --> 01:38.160
I promise you all

01:38.320 --> 01:40.640
Great Xuan has never forgotten the people of the north

01:41.680 --> 01:43.400
The royal army will recover the lost territories

01:44.160 --> 01:46.440
And restore peace to all

01:47.800 --> 01:49.200
This northern expedition

01:49.360 --> 01:50.440
You're risking your life for it

01:55.120 --> 01:56.560
Xuan Kingdom's greatest enemy

01:57.480 --> 01:59.200
Has never been in the north

01:59.720 --> 02:00.840
Minister Chen means

02:04.520 --> 02:05.840
What else does Your Highness want?

02:06.360 --> 02:07.560
My friendship

02:08.600 --> 02:09.840
Does Your Highness dare to want it?

02:10.520 --> 02:11.680
We're not yet established

02:11.800 --> 02:13.600
It's not yet time to move against them

02:14.240 --> 02:15.840
Today the Ministry of Revenue calculated tax revenue

02:15.840 --> 02:17.280
Totaling over 18 million taels

02:17.480 --> 02:21.040
Can shield Your Highness from wind and rain, block swords and spears

02:21.920 --> 02:22.920
It is Huan's fortune

02:25.200 --> 02:28.120
Your Highness, this old minister finally sees you

02:28.400 --> 02:31.080
Everyone has their own account in their heart

02:32.360 --> 02:34.920
If you stay away too long

02:36.360 --> 02:38.000
I'll name the child myself

02:38.440 --> 02:40.000
Speaking of defeat before the battle

02:40.280 --> 02:42.800
Since it's a fight to the death, I won't be a coward

02:43.480 --> 02:45.080
Your Majesty, what do you need?

02:45.480 --> 02:47.320
Just order your servant to do it

02:47.560 --> 02:48.880
Five hundred it is

02:49.600 --> 02:51.240
Five hundred men strike first

02:51.640 --> 02:53.080
No more talk, come

02:56.880 --> 02:58.120
Prince of Jin is rebelling

02:59.160 --> 03:00.320
I am ordered to capture him

03:01.440 --> 03:02.440
Surrender

03:03.040 --> 03:04.280
And your lives will be spared

03:06.800 --> 03:07.680
This northern expedition

03:08.320 --> 03:10.640
Our goal is to recapture Beiyu Pass

03:11.680 --> 03:12.760
Your Highness, Prince of Jin

03:12.920 --> 03:14.480
I'm Liu Dadao

03:14.840 --> 03:17.000
Commander of the Yong'an Garrison Left Army

03:17.920 --> 03:20.880
Old brother, beat the drums for me

03:21.440 --> 03:23.400
Liu, Liu Nian

03:26.160 --> 03:26.840
Your Majesty

03:28.080 --> 03:30.200
When you were in Yiyang, you promised Grandfather

03:31.080 --> 03:34.000
To protect your servant for a lifetime of peace and joy

03:35.360 --> 03:36.200
Your daughter bids farewell

03:37.840 --> 03:41.800
May Father Emperor take care of his sacred body

03:45.360 --> 03:46.680
Do you think the people kneel to you for nothing?

03:47.080 --> 03:48.640
They kneel to me, to Princess Xunyang

03:49.240 --> 03:50.440
Can't catch a wolf without sacrificing the child

03:50.600 --> 03:51.880
Your son is willing to be the vanguard

03:52.480 --> 03:53.680
Murong Cui of Yan Dong

03:54.160 --> 03:55.480
By order of Princess Xunyang

03:55.920 --> 03:56.720
Come to reinforce

03:57.280 --> 03:58.840
It's all because of that Xuan Kingdom emperor

03:59.360 --> 04:01.480
That got us into this situation

04:02.560 --> 04:05.560
At this point, only this last plan remains

04:06.480 --> 04:09.400
This plan, he taught it to me

04:21.480 --> 04:22.080
Chu Meng

04:24.560 --> 04:27.680
Do you know why I must go on the northern expedition?

04:30.160 --> 04:32.840
Your Majesty's achievements now surpass all past and present

04:34.160 --> 04:36.880
The northern expedition requires money

04:38.040 --> 04:39.240
Requires bloodshed

04:40.440 --> 04:42.520
Requires the sacrifice of several generations to complete

04:43.680 --> 04:46.480
But I still must fight

04:47.480 --> 04:50.680
Because this cannot be measured by profit

04:53.200 --> 04:54.600
Because Xuan Kingdom's people

04:56.000 --> 04:57.200
They want to go home

04:58.720 --> 05:00.880
They only recognize Xuan Kingdom as home

05:09.360 --> 05:12.720
Look, look outside

05:13.080 --> 05:13.680
Great victory, great victory

05:14.040 --> 05:14.640
The royal army returns victorious

05:15.080 --> 05:16.040
Long live the Emperor

05:22.080 --> 05:23.080
In your lifetime

05:23.440 --> 05:24.440
You achieved great merits

05:24.720 --> 05:26.120
And committed great mistakes

05:27.000 --> 05:29.520
Some call you a ruthless tyrant

05:29.920 --> 05:31.120
But recovering the divine land

05:31.480 --> 05:34.120
Is also an unparalleled achievement you created

05:35.440 --> 05:36.880
Standing on this mountaintop

05:37.120 --> 05:38.880
You bear tens of thousands of people on your shoulders

05:39.280 --> 05:42.400
Subject to the judgment of later generations, history's pen is iron

05:43.600 --> 05:44.480
Along the way

05:45.040 --> 05:46.440
Love, hate, success, failure

05:46.680 --> 05:48.520
All rest on your single thought

05:49.600 --> 05:51.520
The consequences of every choice

05:51.600 --> 05:53.840
You can only bear alone

05:55.560 --> 05:58.000
Some heroes are made by history

05:58.360 --> 05:59.480
While some heroes

05:59.840 --> 06:01.040
Make history

06:02.280 --> 06:04.200
The ambition to look north at the realm

06:04.480 --> 06:07.800
Will forever exist because of you
