00:01.240 --> 00:04.640
With my meager virtue, I have reigned for 27 years

00:05.680 --> 00:08.240
Worries accumulated in my heart, working diligently without rest

00:08.760 --> 00:11.120
Fearing I would fail the ancestral foundation

00:12.640 --> 00:15.560
Now the realm is settled, the divine land recovered

00:16.200 --> 00:19.280
I am gravely ill and cannot rise

00:19.360 --> 00:20.520
This is the natural way of life and death

00:21.000 --> 00:22.640
Unavoidable for all people, past and present

00:23.280 --> 00:25.000
You need not lament

00:26.200 --> 00:27.800
Grand Censor Wang Ming

00:28.120 --> 00:30.480
Just and loyal, serving the state, inheriting clarity

00:31.080 --> 00:34.040
In the future, he may be the first among your advisors

00:34.600 --> 00:36.200
The succession has found the right person

00:36.560 --> 00:38.160
The ancestral temple and people have someone to rely on

00:38.720 --> 00:40.400
Though I depart this world

00:41.080 --> 00:43.080
What regrets do I have?
