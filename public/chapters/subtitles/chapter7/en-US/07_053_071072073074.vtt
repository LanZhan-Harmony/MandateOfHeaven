00:02.960 --> 00:04.760
The will was sent back to the capital

00:05.360 --> 00:07.040
Xie Xuan was ordered to assist in governance

00:07.640 --> 00:10.280
Crown Prince Sikong Sheng successfully ascended the throne

00:10.920 --> 00:14.000
And changed the era name to Taian the following year

00:28.360 --> 00:29.480
Prince of Yan, how have you been?

00:29.480 --> 00:33.360
However, many military generals led by Zhu Yuanzhi

00:33.640 --> 00:36.200
Still frequently visited Sikong Xu

00:37.040 --> 00:40.640
Causing Sikong Sheng much dissatisfaction

00:41.760 --> 00:44.040
Regent Minister Xie Xuan and his faction

00:44.200 --> 00:47.880
Then began to continuously suppress Zhu Yuanzhi in court

00:48.240 --> 00:53.040
And weakened Zhu Yuanzhi's military power and the Second Prince's faction

00:55.560 --> 00:56.760
General Zhu, please

00:58.320 --> 00:58.720
Please

01:08.720 --> 01:11.040
General Zhu served Father with utmost dedication

01:11.320 --> 01:12.040
Fought all his life

01:12.840 --> 01:14.000
Your Majesty suspects whom

01:14.680 --> 01:15.640
Should not be General Zhu

01:17.000 --> 01:17.800
These years

01:18.320 --> 01:19.800
Your Highness has been friendly with your servant

01:20.560 --> 01:22.200
Why pretend to be confused?

01:22.920 --> 01:25.320
Your Highness has been fighting abroad for so many years

01:25.680 --> 01:26.760
With outstanding military achievements

01:27.600 --> 01:29.160
Everyone sees it

01:29.800 --> 01:32.480
This realm should have been yours

01:34.920 --> 01:37.240
How heroic the late Emperor was

01:38.200 --> 01:42.400
How indecisive and cowardly the current Son of Heaven is

01:42.880 --> 01:44.760
I see Your Highness has the late Emperor's legacy

01:45.280 --> 01:48.960
Only Your Highness can realize the late Emperor's grand vision

01:49.320 --> 01:53.600
We are willing to follow Your Highness to the death

01:59.600 --> 02:02.080
Today I'll act as if General Zhu never said this

02:04.480 --> 02:05.200
Your Highness

02:06.760 --> 02:08.400
Your Highness, this old minister is of this age

02:09.440 --> 02:13.320
Each day I can help you is one less day

02:17.040 --> 02:18.600
But now we only have eight thousand men

02:19.120 --> 02:21.040
When the late Emperor rose up

02:21.800 --> 02:24.000
We had only a few hundred men

02:24.800 --> 02:28.200
A few hundred men still struck first

02:30.640 --> 02:31.280
But

02:31.280 --> 02:32.800
You insist on waiting until everything is too late

02:33.040 --> 02:34.360
And regret it then?

02:47.600 --> 02:48.800
If I can achieve great things

02:49.480 --> 02:52.160
General Zhu will be credited with the first merit
