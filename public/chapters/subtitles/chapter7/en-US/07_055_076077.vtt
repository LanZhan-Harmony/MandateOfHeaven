00:02.120 --> 00:04.320
The Crown Prince's power has already formed

00:04.880 --> 00:07.920
And has a marriage alliance with Grand General Zu Yue's daughter

00:08.360 --> 00:09.320
As long as he remains

00:09.640 --> 00:12.120
Sikong Xu will never be at ease

00:12.920 --> 00:14.360
Right after your death

00:14.640 --> 00:17.520
Sikong Xu, after repeated advice from his advisors

00:17.800 --> 00:19.240
Decided to keep the death secret

00:19.440 --> 00:20.640
Secretly return to the capital

00:21.240 --> 00:22.760
Strike first

00:26.920 --> 00:27.560
However

00:27.720 --> 00:29.720
On Sikong Xu's way back to the capital

00:30.080 --> 00:31.200
When reaching a cliff

00:31.760 --> 00:34.360
The horse seemed to have been drugged

00:34.640 --> 00:37.080
Suddenly began running out of control

00:37.800 --> 00:38.320
Finally

00:38.560 --> 00:40.400
Sikong Xu fell off the cliff

00:41.000 --> 00:42.200
Disappeared without a trace

00:42.840 --> 00:44.680
The news quickly reached the capital

00:45.080 --> 00:46.320
After discussion among court ministers

00:46.560 --> 00:49.720
Decided to welcome the late Emperor's eldest son Sikong Sheng as the new emperor

00:49.720 --> 00:50.720
Father has just passed

00:51.160 --> 00:52.560
My second brother suffered this misfortune

00:53.640 --> 00:55.280
If I follow your suggestion

00:55.400 --> 00:56.200
And ascend the throne now

00:56.440 --> 00:58.080
How will the people view me?

00:58.840 --> 00:59.280
Your Highness

00:59.400 --> 01:01.080
The realm cannot be without a ruler for a day

01:01.280 --> 01:03.280
State affairs cannot be left without a decision, Your Highness

01:03.400 --> 01:03.840
No

01:04.200 --> 01:04.920
Absolutely not

01:05.240 --> 01:06.120
Your Highness

01:06.560 --> 01:07.960
Consider Xuan Kingdom, Your Highness

01:07.960 --> 01:10.760
After three refusals

01:11.280 --> 01:14.080
Sikong Sheng finally ascended the throne

01:14.520 --> 01:16.680
And changed the era name to Taian the following year

01:17.040 --> 01:19.200
Posthumously titled the late Emperor Sikong Yao as Zhao

01:19.400 --> 01:21.400
Historically known as Emperor Xuanzhao
