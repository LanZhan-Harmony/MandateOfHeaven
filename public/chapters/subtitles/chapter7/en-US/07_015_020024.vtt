WEBVTT

00:05.080 --> 00:07.960
This is the grave I've chosen for Shilang

00:10.120 --> 00:12.920
This place is called Tiannan Pass

00:13.320 --> 00:16.680
Composed of two peaks, east and west

00:17.240 --> 00:18.360
Adjacent to Tianhe

00:19.200 --> 00:21.960
Only one narrow path in between for troops to pass

00:22.720 --> 00:24.200
If a large army marches here

00:24.800 --> 00:26.200
They will inevitably form a long line

00:27.080 --> 00:28.680
Front and rear cannot support each other

00:29.440 --> 00:30.240
We only need

00:30.920 --> 00:32.200
To lure the enemy here

00:32.600 --> 00:33.440
The vanguard

00:33.960 --> 00:34.720
Will block Shilang

00:35.560 --> 00:37.840
The rear guard will take the mountain paths

00:38.120 --> 00:39.040
In groups to encircle from behind

00:40.240 --> 00:41.360
If we encounter enemy troops

00:42.200 --> 00:42.960
Don't engage

00:43.960 --> 00:44.960
Just disperse them

00:45.240 --> 00:45.840
And I

00:46.440 --> 00:48.560
Will set the central camp on the mountain

00:49.600 --> 00:51.600
After Shilang's main force is attacked

00:52.240 --> 00:54.600
They will surely flee along the mountain paths

00:55.680 --> 00:56.200
At that time

00:57.360 --> 01:00.440
I will personally lead the central army to intercept the fleeing enemy

01:00.800 --> 01:01.360
This battle

01:02.600 --> 01:04.720
Must completely annihilate their 50,000 main force

01:05.440 --> 01:06.680
Completely

01:08.680 --> 01:09.840
In this way

01:10.080 --> 01:12.120
Shi Wei's so-called 180,000 army

01:12.440 --> 01:13.840
Will scatter like birds and beasts

01:15.600 --> 01:16.680
The Central Plains can be pacified

01:20.720 --> 01:22.200
The task of luring the enemy is very dangerous

01:22.800 --> 01:23.960
Who is willing to be the vanguard?

01:25.720 --> 01:26.080
Father

01:26.800 --> 01:28.200
You can't catch a wolf without risking the child

01:28.320 --> 01:29.720
Your son is willing to be the vanguard

01:32.080 --> 01:32.840
Good

01:33.200 --> 01:34.720
I'll give you a unit of elite cavalry

01:35.200 --> 01:36.800
To lure Shilang's main force into the pass

01:37.440 --> 01:38.040
Yes

01:43.320 --> 01:43.960
Halt

01:43.960 --> 01:44.560
Who goes there?

01:45.480 --> 01:47.440
They say Wuzhao people are brave and skilled

01:47.680 --> 01:48.080
How

01:49.200 --> 01:51.680
How come all I see today are cowards?

01:54.200 --> 01:55.240
Everyone inside, listen

01:55.960 --> 01:57.440
Who dares come out and fight me?

01:59.440 --> 01:59.920
Young General

02:00.040 --> 02:00.480
Young General

02:00.680 --> 02:01.320
General Shilang said

02:01.320 --> 02:02.560
No one is to go out and fight

02:02.720 --> 02:03.600
To hell with that

02:03.840 --> 02:05.560
I'll kill this brat first

02:06.080 --> 02:06.680
Young General

02:06.840 --> 02:07.680
Young General

02:21.360 --> 02:22.360
Report

02:23.360 --> 02:24.240
Shilang's army is moving

02:26.720 --> 02:28.960
Good, the Second Prince is brave

02:30.120 --> 02:32.240
If Shilang wants to maintain morale

02:32.600 --> 02:33.840
He will surely follow

02:35.720 --> 02:36.320
Zu Yue

02:37.840 --> 02:38.960
Lead your troops

02:39.200 --> 02:40.200
To face the Second Prince head-on

02:40.600 --> 02:41.360
Fight while retreating

02:42.360 --> 02:42.840
Your servant

02:43.240 --> 02:43.840
Receives the order

02:48.600 --> 02:49.200
Zhu Yuanzhi

02:50.960 --> 02:53.040
Half an hour after Shilang's main force enters the pass

02:53.720 --> 02:54.840
Lead the ambush troops to attack

02:55.320 --> 02:56.720
Block Shilang's army's retreat

02:57.240 --> 02:58.440
Your servant receives the order

03:08.320 --> 03:10.600
Brat, give me back my son's life

03:28.080 --> 03:29.600
Bad, there's an ambush

03:30.720 --> 03:32.240
Kill

03:33.480 --> 03:37.120
Kill

03:37.120 --> 03:38.400
Kill them

03:41.760 --> 03:44.880
Kill

03:56.320 --> 03:58.520
Kill

04:31.520 --> 04:31.880
Report

04:32.400 --> 04:34.080
Shilang's army has all entered the pass

04:34.600 --> 04:35.680
Shilang discovered he's surrounded

04:35.800 --> 04:36.520
Instead of retreating, he advances

04:36.840 --> 04:38.000
Sending heavy armor to break through

04:38.320 --> 04:40.400
One charge has broken through two lines

04:42.840 --> 04:43.600
They know they're ambushed

04:44.160 --> 04:45.280
Yet still lead the army deeper

04:46.920 --> 04:47.560
Report

04:49.040 --> 04:49.880
Minister Li Dingyuan

04:50.000 --> 04:51.160
Sent an urgent message from the rear

05:00.840 --> 05:01.120
Your Majesty

05:01.840 --> 05:02.520
Some are planning rebellion

05:03.560 --> 05:04.120
Minister Li says

05:04.800 --> 05:06.480
Many gentry believe this battle is hopeless

05:07.080 --> 05:08.080
And are stirring panic in the rear

05:13.280 --> 05:14.560
The Chen and Xie families

05:15.400 --> 05:16.160
Will handle it

05:17.800 --> 05:18.080
Your Majesty

05:18.600 --> 05:19.560
But the Chen family head

05:20.080 --> 05:21.680
Is now the Second Prince's mother
