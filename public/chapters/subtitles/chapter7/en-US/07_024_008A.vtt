WEBVTT

00:02.800 --> 00:06.080
Now we can only trust them

00:09.560 --> 00:10.080
Your Highness

00:10.480 --> 00:12.000
The western neighbor seems to be moving

00:12.320 --> 00:13.840
How can Your Highness suppress this news

00:14.120 --> 00:15.760
And not let His Majesty recall troops to defend

00:16.160 --> 00:16.640
Minister Xue

00:17.360 --> 00:19.120
Father has planned this battle for half his life

00:19.480 --> 00:20.960
You have no solid evidence

00:21.760 --> 00:23.160
How can I issue such an order?

00:23.800 --> 00:25.000
We're not afraid of the unlikely

00:25.120 --> 00:26.520
But the one in ten thousand, Your Highness

00:27.480 --> 00:30.080
If we wait for solid evidence before sending troops

00:30.280 --> 00:31.480
Wouldn't it be too late?

00:32.800 --> 00:34.320
Your Highness is considerate of the Emperor

00:34.640 --> 00:36.360
But now the country's defenses are empty

00:36.560 --> 00:38.000
If the enemy truly invades

00:38.320 --> 00:39.080
And we suffer defeat

00:39.600 --> 00:41.400
Will His Majesty be considerate of Your Highness?

00:44.040 --> 00:45.400
There were heavy rains in the southern border

00:45.960 --> 00:47.600
Which reduced your embezzlement by a bit

00:47.880 --> 00:48.960
So you can't do this job anymore?

00:50.040 --> 00:52.360
Minister Xue, do you think I'm young and easy to bully

00:52.760 --> 00:54.240
And know nothing?

00:55.280 --> 00:58.600
Your Highness, everything I do is for Great Xuan

00:59.080 --> 01:01.720
Your servant is willing to remonstrate with death

01:02.040 --> 01:03.160
Minister Xue, you mustn't

01:03.320 --> 01:04.080
Your Highness

01:04.600 --> 01:07.160
We cannot treat Great Xuan's fate as a game

01:24.560 --> 01:25.840
Lady Chen, what brings you here?

01:26.280 --> 01:27.880
Since Minister Xue wants to remonstrate with death

01:28.320 --> 01:29.280
Go help him

01:29.800 --> 01:30.160
Yes

01:38.720 --> 01:39.160
Chen Wan'er

01:39.520 --> 01:39.880
You

01:40.280 --> 01:40.640
You

01:41.640 --> 01:44.000
You dare kill a senior minister in the Taiji Hall

01:44.360 --> 01:46.360
Do you really think His Majesty will tolerate you later?

01:50.400 --> 01:51.320
Whether he tolerates me

01:52.560 --> 01:54.800
Is a matter between His Majesty and me as husband and wife

01:55.240 --> 01:56.720
You're old

01:57.880 --> 01:59.240
Still so nosy

02:12.400 --> 02:14.040
The Crown Prince is overseeing the court

02:14.560 --> 02:16.240
His Majesty is personally leading the campaign

02:16.640 --> 02:19.280
My son has the courage to fight on the front lines

02:20.000 --> 02:21.080
The Chen family is not panicking

02:21.520 --> 02:22.360
Gentlemen

02:22.760 --> 02:23.520
What are you panicking about?

02:26.360 --> 02:28.160
The decisive battle between Great Xuan and Wuzhao

02:28.640 --> 02:29.720
Is in these few days

02:30.760 --> 02:33.840
You gentlemen shall stay in the palace as guests

02:34.480 --> 02:37.040
I will personally host you

02:39.800 --> 02:41.320
Before the battle is settled

02:42.320 --> 02:43.760
Anyone who passes through this gate

02:44.240 --> 02:44.760
Kill

02:45.800 --> 02:47.240
Those who speak cunningly of retreat

02:47.880 --> 02:48.400
Kill

02:48.880 --> 02:50.400
Those who harm the state for personal gain

02:50.640 --> 02:51.160
Kill

02:53.960 --> 02:55.320
Yes

03:06.240 --> 03:07.720
Raise my royal banner in the formation

03:08.080 --> 03:09.280
Send all the imperial guard

03:09.880 --> 03:10.480
Today

03:10.800 --> 03:12.160
We must not let him escape

03:13.040 --> 03:13.320
Yes

03:21.800 --> 03:22.800
Imperial Guard

03:23.120 --> 03:24.640
Follow me and kill

03:25.480 --> 03:30.080
Kill

03:46.480 --> 03:47.320
Sikong Yao

03:47.960 --> 03:50.560
Today is the life-and-death battle between you and me

03:51.080 --> 03:52.040
Report

03:53.040 --> 03:53.360
My King

03:53.560 --> 03:53.840
Something's wrong

03:54.360 --> 03:55.400
Xuan troops are attacking from behind

03:55.800 --> 03:56.560
Cutting off our retreat

03:56.800 --> 03:57.560
What?

04:04.480 --> 04:06.400
Follow me to cut off their retreat

04:48.280 --> 04:48.720
Brother

04:50.240 --> 04:51.160
Let's retreat

04:52.080 --> 04:53.320
I fell into an ambush

04:54.000 --> 04:55.880
This time, I fell into an ambush

04:57.120 --> 04:58.320
Let's regroup

05:00.800 --> 05:01.080
Brother

05:02.400 --> 05:02.800
Brother

05:05.240 --> 05:05.600
Brother

05:06.080 --> 05:07.720
If not for you, for your son

05:08.480 --> 05:09.320
Not following my orders

05:09.720 --> 05:10.720
And engaging the enemy on your own

05:11.400 --> 05:14.000
How could we have come to this today?

05:14.000 --> 05:14.320
Brother

05:14.840 --> 05:15.240
Don't

05:15.560 --> 05:18.240
My empire was destroyed by you

05:18.760 --> 05:19.080
Brother

05:22.720 --> 05:23.760
Recall the vanguard

05:24.080 --> 05:25.160
Break through from the rear

05:25.520 --> 05:25.880
Yes
