00:07.120 --> 00:08.920
The 26th year of Longwu

00:09.440 --> 00:12.280
Shocking news came from the north

00:13.120 --> 00:16.200
Shilang led a great army south to attack Xuan Kingdom

00:16.480 --> 00:18.560
Claiming to have 180,000 troops

00:19.040 --> 00:20.400
Enough to drink the rivers dry

00:20.680 --> 00:22.360
Their whips could block the flow

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Now Wei Kingdom marches south

00:30.240 --> 00:32.280
Claiming 180,000 armored soldiers

00:32.720 --> 00:34.120
Brave generals like a forest

00:34.280 --> 00:37.040
We truly cannot contend with them

00:37.680 --> 00:38.400
Your servant believes

00:38.680 --> 00:39.800
To shift the strategic focus

00:40.000 --> 00:42.360
From Beiyu Pass to Tianhe

00:42.440 --> 00:44.600
Then we can use the navy to defend

00:44.960 --> 00:46.280
Would be the best strategy

00:47.040 --> 00:47.920
Yes, yes

00:48.280 --> 00:49.880
Chancellor Xie is indeed thoughtful

00:50.720 --> 00:51.360
Your Majesty

00:51.720 --> 00:54.240
Your servant wishes to impeach Xie Jian'an

00:57.280 --> 00:58.160
With a great enemy at hand

00:58.160 --> 00:59.360
Showing cowardice before battle

00:59.600 --> 01:00.600
What is his intention?

01:02.920 --> 01:03.560
Your Majesty

01:03.760 --> 01:06.360
To just give Beiyu Pass to others

01:06.440 --> 01:07.040
Your servant

01:07.240 --> 01:08.800
Absolutely cannot accept

01:09.080 --> 01:09.520
Exactly

01:09.800 --> 01:11.160
We absolutely cannot accept

01:11.320 --> 01:12.520
Censor Wang

01:13.080 --> 01:14.040
This is truly treasonous

01:14.720 --> 01:15.360
I ask you

01:16.240 --> 01:18.880
Holding Beiyu Pass, the battle line is too long

01:18.880 --> 01:19.960
For a large army to fight

01:19.960 --> 01:23.080
How should supplies be provided?

01:23.240 --> 01:25.880
Use the Qing Province canal

01:26.160 --> 01:28.320
The late emperor spent his life building that canal

01:28.680 --> 01:29.040
How

01:29.520 --> 01:30.800
Can it not be used now?

01:31.320 --> 01:32.720
Censor Wang is right

01:33.360 --> 01:34.800
Foolhardy courage

01:35.160 --> 01:37.080
This is reckless behavior

01:37.440 --> 01:39.600
Will lead to disaster

01:39.880 --> 01:40.800
Chancellor Xie is right

01:40.880 --> 01:41.440
What should we do?

01:41.720 --> 01:43.360
I think you're the one who's senile

01:44.520 --> 01:45.720
How do you know without trying?

01:46.240 --> 01:47.520
Truly forgetting one's ancestors
