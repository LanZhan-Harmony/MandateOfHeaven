00:15.000 --> 00:15.800
Drink the medicine

00:16.600 --> 00:17.960
The military doctor prescribed it for pain

00:22.600 --> 00:23.160
One more sip

00:24.240 --> 00:25.160
I don't want it

00:28.080 --> 00:30.800
How did it come to be you lying here?

00:32.520 --> 00:33.360
I heard

00:34.400 --> 00:36.320
You grabbed a horse in the palace and rushed out

00:37.120 --> 00:37.960
The people below

00:38.320 --> 00:39.280
Couldn't stop you

00:39.800 --> 00:40.840
It's only been a few days

00:41.360 --> 00:42.880
And you rushed here in such a hurry

00:44.400 --> 00:45.680
So worried about me

00:46.720 --> 00:48.880
Your servant heard Your Majesty was hit by an arrow

00:49.760 --> 00:50.920
That's why I was so anxious

00:53.880 --> 00:54.800
When Your Majesty is safe

00:55.360 --> 00:56.520
The state will be safe
