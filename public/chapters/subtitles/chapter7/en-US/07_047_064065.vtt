00:00.800 --> 00:02.840
The eldest has a character that understands the greater good

00:03.040 --> 00:04.160
Considers the overall situation

00:04.600 --> 00:06.920
I believe he will prioritize Xuan Kingdom's future

00:08.160 --> 00:09.920
Now Zu Yue controls the army

00:10.480 --> 00:13.480
This can also curb Xu'er's impulsive nature

00:14.760 --> 00:15.800
With her here

00:16.320 --> 00:20.200
Xu'er likely won't easily move against the eldest

00:24.120 --> 00:25.400
Chu Meng

00:26.080 --> 00:27.440
Call the second son

00:31.480 --> 00:32.160
Father

00:33.200 --> 00:34.680
Father clearly said this wound was almost healed

00:35.200 --> 00:36.600
How is this, this

00:37.280 --> 00:38.960
Your elder brother is benevolent and filial

00:39.680 --> 00:40.920
Since you have the edict

00:42.160 --> 00:43.800
He knows it's my intention

00:44.760 --> 00:46.600
He will never make things difficult for you

00:49.840 --> 00:51.280
You understand military affairs

00:51.760 --> 00:53.200
These years of warfare

00:54.240 --> 00:57.360
Have given you sufficient prestige in the army

00:58.960 --> 01:00.440
After you succeed

01:00.800 --> 01:01.960
Your mother

01:02.200 --> 01:05.160
Will make all the noble families submit to you

01:05.520 --> 01:07.000
As your support

01:07.840 --> 01:09.200
I believe

01:10.640 --> 01:12.440
Xuan Kingdom's future affairs

01:13.360 --> 01:14.720
You can handle well

01:17.560 --> 01:19.160
But one thing

01:21.000 --> 01:22.480
I must warn you

01:23.560 --> 01:24.400
Remember

01:25.280 --> 01:27.160
You are family

01:28.040 --> 01:28.560
Your son

01:30.040 --> 01:31.360
Will definitely not become estranged from elder brother

01:32.600 --> 01:35.120
Those things that make people point fingers

01:36.320 --> 01:37.680
In your generation

01:39.480 --> 01:40.840
Don't do them anymore

01:42.960 --> 01:43.880
Your son

01:44.280 --> 01:45.160
Will remember

01:47.880 --> 01:49.160
Rise
