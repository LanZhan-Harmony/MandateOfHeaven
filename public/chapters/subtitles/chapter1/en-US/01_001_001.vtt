00:09.120 --> 00:09.520
This year

00:09.520 --> 00:10.920
The Ministry of Revenue calculated tax revenue

00:10.920 --> 00:12.280
Totaling over eighteen million taels

00:12.680 --> 00:14.520
The relief supplies for Qing Province's people

00:14.600 --> 00:15.640
Grain, seeds, and farming tools

00:15.640 --> 00:17.200
All together cost two million taels

00:17.640 --> 00:18.520
Are already on the way

00:18.680 --> 00:19.560
Will arrive soon

00:20.160 --> 00:20.840
Good

00:22.400 --> 00:23.200
This time

00:23.200 --> 00:24.160
The rebellion in Qing Province

00:24.680 --> 00:26.040
After Chancellor Chen stepped in

00:26.360 --> 00:27.360
Was resolved promptly

00:27.560 --> 00:28.520
Handled properly

00:29.200 --> 00:29.840
Chancellor Chen

00:30.360 --> 00:32.240
You deserve the first credit

00:33.240 --> 00:33.800
Your subject

00:34.240 --> 00:34.920
Is terrified

00:35.600 --> 00:37.800
That this disaster was stopped in time

00:38.120 --> 00:39.040
Is entirely due to Your Majesty

00:39.040 --> 00:40.280
And your boundless grace

00:40.560 --> 00:41.240
And also

00:41.320 --> 00:42.360
Prince of Ning

00:42.360 --> 00:44.160
Working hard in Qing Province

00:44.360 --> 00:46.360
That we achieved this result

00:47.400 --> 00:49.760
The Qing Province canal was able to start smoothly

00:50.080 --> 00:51.000
Has relieved me

00:51.000 --> 00:52.400
Of a great worry

00:53.680 --> 00:54.480
Gentlemen

00:55.040 --> 00:56.680
Is there anything else to report?

00:58.480 --> 00:59.120
Father

00:59.280 --> 01:00.320
Your son has a matter

01:00.360 --> 01:01.920
To request Father's approval

01:02.040 --> 01:02.760
What is it?

01:03.000 --> 01:03.800
Speak freely

01:03.960 --> 01:04.960
The Chen family's eldest daughter

01:04.960 --> 01:06.160
Is virtuous and intelligent

01:06.160 --> 01:07.680
Your son has long admired her

01:08.240 --> 01:08.960
Chancellor Chen

01:09.080 --> 01:11.240
Is like a teacher to your son

01:11.320 --> 01:12.720
Your son wishes to ask Father

01:12.800 --> 01:14.320
To arrange a marriage

01:16.960 --> 01:18.720
I remember this girl

01:18.960 --> 01:19.880
Last time I saw her

01:20.040 --> 01:21.160
She wanted to ask me

01:21.240 --> 01:22.440
For an official position

01:22.800 --> 01:24.440
I almost agreed

01:25.320 --> 01:26.800
Your Majesty, forgive me

01:27.240 --> 01:28.880
Wan'er's father passed early

01:28.960 --> 01:30.600
She's been wild since childhood

01:30.800 --> 01:31.600
However

01:31.720 --> 01:33.240
Your humble subject has always hoped

01:33.320 --> 01:34.600
To find her a good match

01:35.440 --> 01:36.320
If she could receive

01:36.360 --> 01:38.080
Prince of Ning's favor

01:38.320 --> 01:39.880
It would be Wan'er's good fortune

01:41.720 --> 01:42.880
This
