00:00.920 --> 00:02.360
Traitorous thing

00:04.800 --> 00:06.160
Look at our ancestors

00:06.360 --> 00:07.480
Think of what you've done

00:09.440 --> 00:11.080
Do you still know your family name?

00:11.960 --> 00:12.840
Chen

00:13.360 --> 00:14.240
Do you still know?

00:14.600 --> 00:15.880
Don't think those old ones

00:15.880 --> 00:16.960
Can protect you forever

00:19.080 --> 00:20.240
Let her kneel here

00:20.800 --> 00:22.040
For two days to clear her head

00:22.360 --> 00:23.720
No one is to give her food or water

00:48.760 --> 00:52.040
The Great Xuan Dynasty with centuries of foundation

00:52.040 --> 00:55.160
Seems to have long grown accustomed to a corner of the realm

00:55.400 --> 00:57.400
As long as there's the Tianhe as a barrier

00:57.440 --> 01:00.160
The world can safely remain in the south

01:00.160 --> 01:02.160
Amidst song and dance

01:02.360 --> 01:05.200
They've long forgotten the Wutu's iron hooves marching south

01:05.280 --> 01:07.440
Forgotten the shame of being forced to move the capital

01:07.480 --> 01:10.360
Forgotten the fate of the northern people

01:10.840 --> 01:13.000
Whether called virtuous ministers

01:13.000 --> 01:14.720
Or treacherous ministers

01:15.040 --> 01:19.120
In the end, they're all just servants of one family

01:19.760 --> 01:22.120
Just as the Grand Historian once said

01:22.640 --> 01:25.920
All under heaven come bustling for profit

01:26.040 --> 01:30.400
All under heaven go rushing for profit

01:31.240 --> 01:32.960
If one can protect one family's interests

01:32.960 --> 01:34.880
If one can make one clan prosper

01:34.880 --> 01:37.120
What does it matter what name this realm bears

01:37.280 --> 01:39.640
Or to whom this land belongs?

01:39.680 --> 01:41.800
What does it matter?

01:42.200 --> 01:43.840
In these turbulent times

01:44.000 --> 01:46.560
Some are full of concern, thinking of danger in peace

01:46.680 --> 01:49.400
Some are wise and self-preserving, thinking of retreat

01:49.520 --> 01:53.120
Some clearly see the times and quietly think of change

01:53.720 --> 01:57.440
After all, is it for one family's benefit in one generation

01:57.440 --> 02:01.160
Or for the welfare of all under heaven for a hundred years...

02:01.760 --> 02:02.680
I hope you

02:02.680 --> 02:06.560
In this torrent of the times, can forever preserve

02:07.280 --> 02:09.960
Your original heart...
