00:01.440 --> 00:02.200
When I came

00:02.520 --> 00:03.600
I hadn't eaten yet

00:05.160 --> 00:06.200
Elder brother probably isn't hungry, right?

00:07.080 --> 00:07.520
This

00:09.320 --> 00:10.840
Mother, the pastries you made are delicious

00:11.080 --> 00:12.320
Good, good, good

00:12.840 --> 00:14.520
It's good that Yao'er likes them

00:14.760 --> 00:16.520
I'll make a few more boxes later

00:16.760 --> 00:18.160
And have them sent to your residence

00:18.960 --> 00:19.760
Of course

00:20.200 --> 00:21.880
The elder one won't be left out

00:25.080 --> 00:25.960
Thank you, Mother
