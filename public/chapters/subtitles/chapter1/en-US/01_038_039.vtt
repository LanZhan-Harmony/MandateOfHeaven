00:00.520 --> 00:01.200
Father ordered me

00:01.200 --> 00:02.680
To investigate the details of your treason

00:03.040 --> 00:04.640
If you confess voluntarily

00:04.960 --> 00:06.400
You can avoid physical punishment

00:06.960 --> 00:07.960
I led troops

00:08.240 --> 00:08.680
To

00:08.680 --> 00:10.360
Investigate the embezzlement of relief funds

00:10.640 --> 00:11.720
You say I committed treason

00:12.200 --> 00:13.120
What evidence do you have?

00:13.600 --> 00:14.360
Evidence

00:14.960 --> 00:15.640
The evidence is

00:15.640 --> 00:17.600
That warehouse full of armor and weapons

00:19.200 --> 00:20.280
Great Xuan's law

00:20.840 --> 00:22.440
Privately storing ten sets of armor

00:22.960 --> 00:24.040
Is considered treason

00:25.400 --> 00:26.520
What you stored

00:26.720 --> 00:28.360
Far exceeds ten sets

00:28.480 --> 00:29.480
That is crime one

00:29.600 --> 00:30.520
Without orders

00:30.640 --> 00:32.120
Privately deploying city defense troops

00:32.120 --> 00:33.680
Causing the capital's defenses to be empty

00:33.880 --> 00:35.160
Endangering the Son of Heaven

00:35.440 --> 00:36.280
That is crime two

00:36.960 --> 00:37.640
Not to mention

00:37.640 --> 00:39.840
Whether you actually had treasonous thoughts

00:40.480 --> 00:41.880
Just these two crimes alone

00:41.880 --> 00:43.120
Either one

00:43.440 --> 00:44.880
You cannot escape death
