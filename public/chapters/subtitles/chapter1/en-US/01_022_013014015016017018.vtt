00:06.640 --> 00:07.200
Action

00:08.440 --> 00:09.040
Move

00:23.120 --> 00:24.920
Ordered to investigate stolen supplies

00:25.200 --> 00:26.360
Those who resist

00:26.520 --> 00:27.640
Will be executed on the spot

00:28.040 --> 00:28.440
Search

00:45.200 --> 00:46.360
A mob

00:46.440 --> 00:48.120
Didn't expect it to be so easy

00:48.240 --> 00:49.440
Don't you think

00:49.600 --> 00:51.160
Things went too smoothly?

00:52.920 --> 00:53.480
Here

00:54.880 --> 00:55.200
Report

00:55.680 --> 00:57.120
No grain found in the warehouse

00:57.360 --> 00:58.760
Only weapons and armor

00:58.960 --> 00:59.440
What?

01:10.920 --> 01:11.680
Report

01:13.240 --> 01:13.960
A unit of elite troops

01:13.960 --> 01:14.880
Is approaching us

01:16.240 --> 01:16.960
Elite troops

01:17.280 --> 01:18.640
Now besides the city defense troops

01:18.720 --> 01:19.720
Where else are there troops?

01:20.200 --> 01:21.360
I see on the banner

01:21.400 --> 01:22.400
The character "Zu"

01:23.640 --> 01:24.440
It's the border army

01:25.000 --> 01:25.600
Oh no

01:26.040 --> 01:26.760
We've been tricked

01:27.120 --> 01:27.440
Go

01:32.400 --> 01:33.200
Rebellious son

01:33.280 --> 01:34.680
This rebellious son

01:35.800 --> 01:37.440
So impatient?

01:38.160 --> 01:38.960
Your Majesty

01:39.720 --> 01:42.440
The capital is now in constant danger

01:42.760 --> 01:43.440
Your subject requests

01:43.720 --> 01:46.720
To immediately deploy border troops to suppress the rebels

01:47.200 --> 01:47.720
Yes

01:48.640 --> 01:49.800
Yes, yes, yes

01:50.240 --> 01:51.960
Zu Kun returned to the capital to report

01:52.120 --> 01:54.040
My border army is nearby

01:54.640 --> 01:56.200
Who's leading them again?

01:56.960 --> 01:57.880
General Fenwei

01:58.520 --> 01:59.200
Zu Yue

02:00.440 --> 02:00.960
Retreat

02:01.160 --> 02:01.960
Retreat, retreat

02:14.400 --> 02:15.720
Prince of Jin has rebelled

02:16.520 --> 02:18.000
I am ordered to capture him

02:18.960 --> 02:20.200
Surrender

02:20.640 --> 02:22.120
And your lives will be spared

02:23.880 --> 02:25.600
I give you three breaths

02:26.160 --> 02:27.160
Drop your weapons

02:29.440 --> 02:29.920
Three

02:34.160 --> 02:34.640
Your Highness

02:35.280 --> 02:36.880
Inside are only armor and weapons

02:37.400 --> 02:38.000
Let's fight our way out

02:38.600 --> 02:39.120
Two
