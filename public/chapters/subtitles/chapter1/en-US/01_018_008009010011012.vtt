00:02.000 --> 00:02.640
Alright

00:03.520 --> 00:04.440
What needs to be said

00:04.800 --> 00:05.720
I've said it all

00:06.560 --> 00:08.560
Your Highness need not rush to agree

00:10.760 --> 00:12.200
Wan'er judges by actions

00:12.480 --> 00:13.640
Not by words

00:14.160 --> 00:15.600
The news I overheard is

00:15.960 --> 00:17.560
Tonight this batch of money and grain

00:17.960 --> 00:19.440
Will be transported by ferry

00:20.080 --> 00:21.240
To do or not

00:21.920 --> 00:23.560
Is up to Your Highness

00:42.680 --> 00:43.240
Your Highness

00:43.480 --> 00:44.200
I sent scouts

00:44.480 --> 00:45.080
That place

00:45.080 --> 00:46.600
Indeed has a secret warehouse

00:47.440 --> 00:48.480
Looking from afar

00:48.680 --> 00:50.360
I saw them transporting supplies

00:50.840 --> 00:51.960
I'm afraid after tonight

00:52.120 --> 00:53.480
That warehouse will be gone

00:55.080 --> 00:55.600
Your Highness

00:56.080 --> 00:57.120
Dispatch troops immediately

00:57.240 --> 00:58.000
Without orders

00:58.000 --> 00:59.480
Where do we get troops?

00:59.720 --> 01:00.440
The city defense troops

01:02.720 --> 01:03.840
Are all my sworn brothers

01:04.080 --> 01:04.960
Don't need orders

01:05.480 --> 01:06.600
As long as Your Highness agrees

01:06.680 --> 01:07.960
I'll lead them out immediately

01:08.000 --> 01:10.080
Privately deploying troops is a serious crime

01:10.080 --> 01:12.800
And you're deploying the capital's defense troops

01:15.720 --> 01:16.600
This matter

01:17.200 --> 01:18.480
As long as the evidence is solid

01:18.960 --> 01:20.840
We can explain to His Majesty afterward

01:21.120 --> 01:22.600
His Majesty will surely show mercy

01:22.840 --> 01:23.800
Turn major into minor

01:24.360 --> 01:25.080
At most

01:25.920 --> 01:28.000
I'll just lose one position

01:29.080 --> 01:29.600
Your Highness

01:29.840 --> 01:30.920
This opportunity must not be missed
