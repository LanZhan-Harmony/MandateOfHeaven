WEBVTT

00:00.600 --> 00:02.120
Stubborn and unyielding

00:02.520 --> 00:03.160
Beat him

00:03.680 --> 00:04.960
Beat him hard

00:05.320 --> 00:06.400
Until he admits

00:20.480 --> 00:21.560
The course of events

00:22.160 --> 00:23.320
Is roughly like this

00:24.760 --> 00:26.120
Perhaps even the court proposal

00:26.520 --> 00:27.840
For the marriage alliance

00:28.040 --> 00:29.840
Was designed by my granduncle Chen Dao

00:30.800 --> 00:31.360
Then

00:32.000 --> 00:33.840
He deliberately let me find the flaw

00:34.360 --> 00:35.200
This time

00:35.480 --> 00:36.560
I was careless

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Prince of Jin's disaster

00:41.080 --> 00:41.960
Is my fault

00:42.440 --> 00:44.040
I will definitely find a way to solve it

00:48.480 --> 00:50.000
Even if it's as you said

00:50.680 --> 00:52.440
They will definitely try everything

00:52.520 --> 00:53.960
To have Prince of Jin die unjustly in prison

00:54.840 --> 00:56.840
Prince of Ning might consider brotherly love

00:57.000 --> 00:58.160
And hesitate to act

00:59.280 --> 01:00.480
But given time

01:00.800 --> 01:02.320
He might change his mind

01:03.000 --> 01:04.480
The prince is still in danger

01:05.800 --> 01:06.840
Prince of Jin's crime

01:07.480 --> 01:08.760
Is too great

01:09.960 --> 01:11.120
To clear it

01:11.640 --> 01:12.560
Is impossible

01:17.680 --> 01:18.880
There's only one way

01:19.920 --> 01:20.880
Find Chen Dao's

01:21.080 --> 01:22.800
Evidence of embezzling relief funds

01:23.120 --> 01:24.800
To prove Prince of Jin's original intent in leading troops

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Was not wrong

01:26.600 --> 01:27.520
Second

01:27.800 --> 01:28.600
Second

01:28.920 --> 01:30.640
Have Prince of Jin connect this matter

01:30.840 --> 01:32.120
To the succession struggle

01:32.680 --> 01:34.160
His Majesty will surely become suspicious

01:34.480 --> 01:36.200
Only this way can we gain a chance

01:36.840 --> 01:37.880
This way

01:38.120 --> 01:40.520
The emperor will re-examine the entire matter

01:41.480 --> 01:43.280
As long as the emperor is willing to see Prince of Jin

01:43.440 --> 01:44.800
There will be a turning point

01:45.280 --> 01:45.880
But

01:46.000 --> 01:47.400
Where do we find the evidence?
