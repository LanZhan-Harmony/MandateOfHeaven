00:01.520 --> 00:02.160
Find the Empress

00:03.920 --> 00:05.240
The matter of Prince of Jin's misfortune

00:05.440 --> 00:07.240
Probably hasn't spread widely

00:07.640 --> 00:08.640
I, as a daughter-in-law

00:08.680 --> 00:09.720
Going to visit Mother

00:10.080 --> 00:11.080
Might not be stopped

00:11.520 --> 00:13.240
Though the Empress never interferes in court matters

00:13.800 --> 00:15.240
She must care for her son

00:15.720 --> 00:16.320
Indeed

00:16.520 --> 00:17.280
At this time

00:17.760 --> 00:19.880
I'm afraid only the Empress can delay Prince of Ning

00:36.400 --> 00:37.560
Perhaps

00:38.240 --> 00:39.640
Chancellor Chen was right

00:54.160 --> 00:54.400
Sir

00:54.720 --> 00:55.000
Sir

00:55.720 --> 00:56.280
Sir

00:56.800 --> 00:57.800
Rash and hasty

00:58.240 --> 00:58.920
Rushing to be reborn

00:59.040 --> 00:59.280
Sir

00:59.640 --> 00:59.920
Your Highness

01:01.280 --> 01:01.720
Empress

01:03.920 --> 01:05.520
This palace's rashness

01:06.000 --> 01:07.560
Must have made Sir Chen laugh

01:07.720 --> 01:08.800
Empress, Mother

01:15.080 --> 01:16.600
How dare you

01:17.560 --> 01:19.120
Beat my son like this

01:19.640 --> 01:20.240
Prince

01:21.240 --> 01:23.040
Release him immediately

01:28.160 --> 01:28.800
Hurry

01:50.760 --> 01:51.840
Everyone, leave first

01:52.360 --> 01:52.880
Mother

01:54.120 --> 01:55.240
Aren't you leaving?

01:56.400 --> 01:57.560
Waiting for me to scold you?

01:58.720 --> 02:00.400
You might as well scold me to vent your anger

02:00.400 --> 02:01.200
Get out

02:03.640 --> 02:04.160
Yes

02:11.200 --> 02:11.720
Prince

02:12.320 --> 02:13.160
I came too late

02:23.760 --> 02:24.800
You three men

02:25.440 --> 02:27.520
Are like pressing down a gourd and a ladle pops up

02:28.120 --> 02:30.200
None of you let me rest easy

02:31.240 --> 02:33.120
Just watched your father take medicine

02:33.920 --> 02:35.280
And now you two brothers

02:35.760 --> 02:37.040
Are fighting like this

02:38.360 --> 02:40.360
I don't understand your schemes

02:41.200 --> 02:42.240
You and your elder brother

02:42.240 --> 02:43.760
Are both my flesh and blood

02:46.520 --> 02:47.280
Sometimes

02:49.280 --> 02:51.800
I feel like a porter

02:52.720 --> 02:54.680
Must balance both ends of the carrying pole

02:55.320 --> 02:57.400
Can't favor either side

02:58.280 --> 02:59.720
Father's health

03:00.560 --> 03:01.440
Is it alright?

03:02.040 --> 03:02.920
You know

03:04.240 --> 03:05.120
Your father usually

03:05.120 --> 03:07.200
Likes to mess with those elixirs

03:07.720 --> 03:09.280
His health was already poor

03:10.440 --> 03:11.440
With this trouble

03:12.880 --> 03:14.760
He's been bedridden for days again

03:18.840 --> 03:20.440
Your father doesn't want to see you now

03:21.240 --> 03:22.400
If you have something to say

03:23.080 --> 03:24.360
I'll say it for you

03:25.600 --> 03:26.560
Thank you, Mother

03:27.760 --> 03:29.280
Please tell Father
