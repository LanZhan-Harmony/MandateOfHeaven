00:04.600 --> 00:05.760
At this moment

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
A fierce wind blows

00:09.080 --> 00:10.720
The Taiji Hall plaque

00:10.920 --> 00:12.080
Is blown down by the wind

00:12.360 --> 00:14.440
And lands at your feet

00:17.880 --> 00:19.200
You seize the opportunity

00:19.200 --> 00:20.360
Lift the plaque

00:20.360 --> 00:21.440
Climb high and shout

00:21.440 --> 00:22.480
Heaven's mandate is with me

00:22.760 --> 00:23.520
You all

00:23.520 --> 00:25.440
Surrender quickly

00:25.720 --> 00:27.320
Kill

00:27.640 --> 00:28.440
This shout

00:28.520 --> 00:30.400
Not only greatly boosts your side's morale

00:30.440 --> 00:32.400
But also shakes the defenders' resolve

00:32.520 --> 00:34.000
Cornered as you are

00:34.000 --> 00:34.920
Fight heroically

00:34.920 --> 00:36.160
Successfully break through

00:36.160 --> 00:38.160
And ascend the throne

00:38.320 --> 00:40.720
Enthrone the Chen family's eldest daughter as Lady Chen

00:40.800 --> 00:42.600
Change the era name to Tianming

00:44.560 --> 00:46.360
Because the throne was gained unjustly

00:46.400 --> 00:47.920
You know your sins are grave

00:47.960 --> 00:49.400
To atone for your wrongs

00:49.400 --> 00:50.720
You diligently govern

00:50.720 --> 00:51.920
Working from dawn to dusk

00:52.360 --> 00:53.720
With the virtuous Empress Xie

00:53.720 --> 00:54.680
Managing internal affairs

00:54.920 --> 00:55.680
And the female chancellor

00:55.680 --> 00:57.680
Lady Chen assisting at your side

00:58.400 --> 01:00.600
Talented ministers and brave generals emerge

01:00.600 --> 01:01.680
With the entire nation's strength

01:01.680 --> 01:02.920
You advance the northern campaign

01:02.920 --> 01:04.600
Like splitting bamboo

01:04.880 --> 01:06.200
In the seventh year of Tianming

01:06.280 --> 01:07.880
Sikong Yao personally leads a great army

01:07.880 --> 01:08.960
To capture Yong'an

01:09.360 --> 01:09.880
The Wutu

01:09.880 --> 01:11.320
Had already gathered a hundred thousand

01:11.320 --> 01:12.600
To cut off your retreat

01:12.640 --> 01:14.280
Unexpectedly, fire stones fall from heaven

01:14.360 --> 01:15.880
Landing on the Wutu camp

01:16.120 --> 01:18.400
The Wutu army collapses

01:18.840 --> 01:20.800
The Wutu general Shi Lang exclaims

01:21.720 --> 01:24.920
This is heaven's mandate

01:26.040 --> 01:26.680
Then

01:26.920 --> 01:28.920
He commits suicide

01:31.800 --> 01:33.120
In the tenth year of Tianming

01:33.400 --> 01:34.440
The lost northern territories

01:34.480 --> 01:35.720
Are all recovered

01:36.120 --> 01:37.400
Neighboring countries

01:37.840 --> 01:39.720
All submit

01:42.560 --> 01:44.360
In the twenty-ninth year of Tianming

01:44.360 --> 01:46.680
Sikong Yao dies after taking elixirs

01:47.240 --> 01:49.040
Because the world knows his throne was gained unjustly

01:49.480 --> 01:51.640
There is much debate about his merits and faults

01:51.640 --> 01:53.840
Finally honoring him as Emperor Xuanlie

01:54.400 --> 01:55.200
But among the people

01:55.200 --> 01:57.080
They prefer another name
