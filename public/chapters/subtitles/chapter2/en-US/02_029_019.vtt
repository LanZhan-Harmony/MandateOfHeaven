00:06.040 --> 00:06.720
This humble one

00:07.040 --> 00:08.520
Originally came with a poem today

00:09.000 --> 00:09.560
But

00:17.280 --> 00:18.280
Today, this humble one

00:18.520 --> 00:19.280
Saw the general

00:19.440 --> 00:21.320
Walking side by side with Prince of Jin

00:22.000 --> 00:23.080
Was suddenly inspired

00:23.720 --> 00:24.840
And hastily composed a new verse

00:25.280 --> 00:25.960
For the general

00:26.280 --> 00:27.440
I humbly present it here

00:28.560 --> 00:29.040
Please

00:31.800 --> 00:33.520
The general returns south

00:34.040 --> 00:35.600
Then goes north again

00:36.200 --> 00:37.600
Jin residence's night lamps

00:38.120 --> 00:39.680
Accompany fading fireflies

00:40.720 --> 00:42.200
Where heaven's spear points

00:42.200 --> 00:43.080
No strong formation stands

00:43.480 --> 00:45.040
Shine on our land

00:45.560 --> 00:46.960
All seas peaceful

00:47.040 --> 00:47.760
Good

00:50.280 --> 00:51.320
I mean

00:51.800 --> 00:54.000
"Shine on our land, all seas peaceful"

00:54.440 --> 00:55.360
This line is good

00:57.880 --> 00:59.520
From whose school are you?

01:00.000 --> 01:00.680
I am ashamed

01:01.320 --> 01:02.080
I studied under

01:02.560 --> 01:04.040
The former Chancellor of the Imperial Academy

01:04.520 --> 01:05.360
Yu Gong

01:07.200 --> 01:08.600
Exterminate all villains

01:08.720 --> 01:10.040
Recover our land

01:10.320 --> 01:11.320
Is also I, Zu's

01:11.520 --> 01:12.560
Lifelong wish

01:12.960 --> 01:13.760
I, Zu

01:14.120 --> 01:15.360
Toast to a fellow traveler

01:17.320 --> 01:17.880
We

01:18.240 --> 01:19.520
With the general and scholars

01:20.280 --> 01:20.960
Drink together
