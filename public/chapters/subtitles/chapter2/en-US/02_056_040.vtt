00:03.680 --> 00:04.520
General Zu

00:04.880 --> 00:06.800
This year you repeatedly repelled the Wutu

00:07.040 --> 00:08.720
You are a great hero

00:09.760 --> 00:11.600
Above, by His Majesty's great fortune

00:11.800 --> 00:13.040
Below, by the soldiers' efforts

00:13.280 --> 00:14.320
There is no reason not to win

00:15.040 --> 00:16.360
Last year we couldn't go north

00:16.520 --> 00:17.680
It was indeed a pity

00:18.120 --> 00:19.520
This general's return to the capital this time

00:19.680 --> 00:20.880
Is also to discuss with Your Majesty

00:21.000 --> 00:22.040
This matter again

00:25.040 --> 00:25.840
The Chen family

00:25.840 --> 00:26.600
The Xie family

00:27.040 --> 00:29.240
And my two sons are all here

00:29.600 --> 00:30.600
Feel free to speak freely

00:30.800 --> 00:31.680
What do you all

00:31.680 --> 00:32.560
Think about this?

00:38.200 --> 00:39.240
Victory is easy to talk about

00:39.560 --> 00:40.680
But what if we lose?

00:42.040 --> 00:43.800
Speaking of defeat before even fighting

00:44.600 --> 00:45.760
You've been in the capital so long

00:45.760 --> 00:46.800
Your bones have gone soft

00:48.040 --> 00:49.800
Want to be the Wutu's sons

00:50.040 --> 00:51.440
Discuss matters, just discuss matters

00:51.600 --> 00:53.000
Don't ramble on here

00:57.960 --> 00:58.600
Father

00:59.000 --> 00:59.840
Your son believes

01:00.120 --> 01:01.200
We should go north

01:02.040 --> 01:03.720
But not right now

01:04.040 --> 01:04.840
After all

01:05.760 --> 01:06.760
The court has no money

01:07.040 --> 01:08.200
The people have no money either

01:08.520 --> 01:09.960
If we fight this war now

01:10.320 --> 01:11.680
How can people survive?

01:12.280 --> 01:13.040
Then where's the money?

01:13.760 --> 01:15.320
This money isn't in the people's hands

01:15.600 --> 01:16.840
Nor in the court's treasury

01:17.360 --> 01:18.240
Where did the money go?

01:19.280 --> 01:20.040
Prince of Ning

01:20.360 --> 01:21.480
Don't you have anything to say?

01:21.720 --> 01:22.280
Boy

01:22.840 --> 01:24.760
You must be very careful with your words

01:24.800 --> 01:25.360
It's fine

01:26.680 --> 01:27.600
Father said

01:28.040 --> 01:28.800
Today we can

01:28.800 --> 01:29.800
Speak freely

01:30.440 --> 01:31.480
But second brother

01:32.080 --> 01:33.600
You should also give your opinion
