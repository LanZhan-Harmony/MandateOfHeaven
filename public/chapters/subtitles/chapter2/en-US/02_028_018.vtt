00:00.600 --> 00:01.520
This humble one

00:01.680 --> 00:02.440
For the general

00:02.440 --> 00:04.840
Composed when the general repelled the Wutu at the start of the year

00:05.680 --> 00:06.600
The writing is crude

00:06.760 --> 00:08.520
But the sentiment comes from the heart

00:08.840 --> 00:09.920
I humbly present it here

00:10.360 --> 00:10.960
Please

00:11.880 --> 00:13.760
Beacon fires on three borders

00:13.960 --> 00:15.400
The great river flows

00:16.280 --> 00:17.600
Ten thousand li of barbarian dust

00:18.160 --> 00:19.880
Cleared like autumn

00:20.960 --> 00:22.360
From now on, all under heaven

00:22.640 --> 00:24.120
Shall be peaceful

00:24.640 --> 00:26.640
And let the spring breeze

00:28.120 --> 00:29.800
Pass over splendor

00:30.120 --> 00:30.760
Good

00:34.200 --> 00:35.600
I mean

00:35.760 --> 00:38.200
"From now on, all under heaven shall be peaceful"

00:38.680 --> 00:39.640
This line is good

00:40.560 --> 00:41.280
You are

00:41.280 --> 00:42.600
From whose school?

00:42.880 --> 00:43.600
I am ashamed

00:44.600 --> 00:45.560
I studied under

00:45.840 --> 00:46.560
The former

00:47.040 --> 00:48.640
Chancellor of the Imperial Academy

00:49.600 --> 00:51.040
Yu Gong

00:55.200 --> 00:56.280
Your poem

00:56.560 --> 00:57.840
Has great vision

00:58.760 --> 00:59.600
I, Zu

00:59.840 --> 01:01.080
Toast to a fellow traveler

01:01.360 --> 01:02.040
We

01:02.120 --> 01:03.120
With General Zu

01:03.120 --> 01:04.080
And the scholars

01:04.120 --> 01:04.760
Drink together

01:05.160 --> 01:05.760
Please
