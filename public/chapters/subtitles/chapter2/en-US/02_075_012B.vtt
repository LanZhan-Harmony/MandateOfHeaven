00:02.000 --> 00:02.640
I'm not drunk

00:03.280 --> 00:03.960
Don't need hangover soup

00:04.280 --> 00:05.120
Your Highness

00:05.840 --> 00:07.440
Are you afraid I put

00:07.720 --> 00:08.360
Poison in this soup?

00:18.280 --> 00:18.920
Your Highness

00:20.440 --> 00:22.160
Now you can be at ease

00:30.600 --> 00:32.280
The hangover soup has herbs added

00:32.960 --> 00:34.480
Tomorrow you won't have a hangover headache

00:46.240 --> 00:47.480
I'm afraid I should go

00:47.760 --> 00:49.120
Wan'er respectfully sees off Your Highness

00:59.920 --> 01:00.720
Ruolan

01:01.800 --> 01:02.960
I'll learn from it later

01:02.960 --> 01:04.160
The food at other people's residences

01:04.560 --> 01:05.520
So no one will

01:05.520 --> 01:07.320
Worry that you're tired of it

01:07.320 --> 01:08.760
Or that I'm starving you

01:16.440 --> 01:18.120
The smell of alcohol is so strong

01:18.840 --> 01:20.080
Go back and rest early

01:20.080 --> 01:21.960
You stay up all night reading documents

01:22.040 --> 01:22.600
That light

01:22.600 --> 01:24.000
Keeps me from sleeping well

01:25.280 --> 01:26.600
I respectfully obey Her Highness's decree
