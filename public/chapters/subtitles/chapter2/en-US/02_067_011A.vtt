00:00.880 --> 00:01.960
In your son's view

00:02.480 --> 00:03.720
The Wutu have five weaknesses

00:04.200 --> 00:04.840
The royal army

00:05.200 --> 00:05.880
Has five strengths

00:07.920 --> 00:09.160
Tell me

00:09.320 --> 00:10.080
The Wutu

00:10.360 --> 00:11.600
Rule with tyranny

00:12.240 --> 00:13.840
While our dynasty governs with benevolence

00:14.320 --> 00:15.400
This is governance victory

00:15.880 --> 00:17.320
The Wutu are fierce and arrogant

00:17.760 --> 00:18.680
While the royal army

00:18.880 --> 00:20.080
Has strict military discipline

00:20.520 --> 00:21.480
This is discipline victory

00:21.880 --> 00:23.360
The Wutu tribes constantly fight among themselves

00:23.800 --> 00:25.400
While our dynasty is united

00:25.760 --> 00:26.720
This is unity victory

00:27.280 --> 00:28.760
The Wutu fight only with brute courage

00:29.080 --> 00:30.320
While the royal army excels at strategy

00:30.480 --> 00:31.320
This is strategy victory

00:32.160 --> 00:34.160
The Wutu entered the central plains as rebels

00:34.640 --> 00:35.360
Our dynasty

00:35.640 --> 00:37.160
Recovers the homeland with legitimacy

00:37.840 --> 00:38.960
This is righteousness victory

00:40.160 --> 00:41.280
With these five strengths

00:41.840 --> 00:43.160
Going north against the Wutu

00:43.400 --> 00:44.520
How can we speak of defeat?
