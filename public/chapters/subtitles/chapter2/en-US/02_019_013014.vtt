00:03.640 --> 00:04.200
Two people

00:04.400 --> 00:05.120
Move this inside

00:05.200 --> 00:05.640
Carefully

00:06.000 --> 00:06.680
Please come in

00:07.440 --> 00:08.000
Hurry

00:13.880 --> 00:14.800
Why did we stop here?

00:19.160 --> 00:19.920
Careful, please come in

00:23.280 --> 00:24.880
Blocked outside, can't get through

00:25.400 --> 00:26.080
I'll clear a path

00:26.080 --> 00:26.400
No need

00:27.320 --> 00:28.400
Let's walk

00:30.560 --> 00:31.520
Prince of Ning

00:31.920 --> 00:32.680
General Zu

00:32.920 --> 00:33.800
Please come in

00:35.800 --> 00:37.160
Prince of Ning's meaning

00:37.280 --> 00:38.280
I understand

00:38.400 --> 00:39.520
If the general has difficulties

00:39.640 --> 00:41.280
In the capital or elsewhere

00:41.400 --> 00:43.000
You can directly send someone to inform me

00:43.160 --> 00:43.800
I will

00:43.880 --> 00:45.280
Do my utmost to help

00:45.760 --> 00:46.680
Thank you

00:48.400 --> 00:50.200
What a grand gesture

00:50.640 --> 00:51.680
Move faster

00:52.040 --> 00:53.200
Don't block others from coming and going

00:56.560 --> 00:57.680
Second brother is here too

00:58.120 --> 00:59.440
Greetings to Prince of Jin

01:00.880 --> 01:01.680
General Zu

01:02.680 --> 01:03.280
Elder brother

01:04.280 --> 01:05.120
Why

01:05.120 --> 01:06.280
Did you walk here yourself?

01:08.000 --> 01:09.200
I blocked the way ahead

01:09.560 --> 01:11.040
If you have anything to move

01:11.160 --> 01:12.160
I'll have them help you move it

01:12.320 --> 01:13.440
No need to trouble elder brother
