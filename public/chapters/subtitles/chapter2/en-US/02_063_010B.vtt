00:01.480 --> 00:03.160
Temporary hardship for the people

00:03.440 --> 00:04.640
Compared to the ancestors'

00:04.640 --> 00:06.160
Realm and state

00:06.360 --> 00:07.360
Which is more important?

00:08.080 --> 00:09.160
I think Father's heart

00:09.160 --> 00:10.200
Has its own decision

00:12.040 --> 00:13.240
As for burdening the people

00:13.480 --> 00:14.480
The court increases taxes

00:14.480 --> 00:15.360
Collects grain and fodder

00:15.640 --> 00:16.240
All policies

00:16.240 --> 00:17.360
Can all be issued in my name

00:17.560 --> 00:18.240
The blame

00:18.560 --> 00:19.280
I will bear

00:19.440 --> 00:20.640
You are Prince of Jin

00:20.960 --> 00:22.160
My son

00:22.400 --> 00:23.280
Cursing you

00:23.480 --> 00:24.320
Is the same as cursing me

00:24.320 --> 00:25.760
And cursing the entire court

00:25.960 --> 00:26.920
What's the difference?
