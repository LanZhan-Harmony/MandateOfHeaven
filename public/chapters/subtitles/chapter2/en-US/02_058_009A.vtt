00:06.520 --> 00:07.680
Father asks your son

00:07.880 --> 00:08.560
Whether to go north

00:09.160 --> 00:10.320
Your son dares not say what's right

00:10.680 --> 00:11.600
Your son only knows

00:11.880 --> 00:13.440
Father shoulders the ancestral state

00:13.920 --> 00:15.640
Assumed the throne in times of crisis

00:15.880 --> 00:17.600
Turned the tide in an instant

00:18.800 --> 00:20.640
Now the north is in constant warfare

00:21.320 --> 00:23.080
Hundreds of thousands of refugees along the Tianhe

00:23.080 --> 00:24.000
Have no home

00:24.800 --> 00:25.840
Qing Province has troubles

00:26.080 --> 00:27.320
Floods in the east

00:27.640 --> 00:28.880
Drought in the west

00:29.360 --> 00:30.640
Liang Province has famine

00:31.280 --> 00:32.520
The war with the Wutu

00:32.680 --> 00:33.880
Has reached a critical moment again

00:34.160 --> 00:34.840
In this situation

00:35.360 --> 00:36.600
If any one matter is mishandled

00:37.080 --> 00:38.400
The state faces the risk of collapse

00:39.240 --> 00:40.640
Father has reigned for over a decade

00:41.080 --> 00:42.440
Whether we should go north

00:42.880 --> 00:43.840
Or not

00:44.520 --> 00:46.440
Or wait for the right time to go north

00:47.400 --> 00:49.560
Father understands the stakes better than your son

00:50.400 --> 00:51.360
What your son can do

00:51.800 --> 00:53.320
Is to fully cooperate with Father

00:53.840 --> 00:55.120
Whatever Father asks your son to do

00:55.520 --> 00:56.920
Your son will strive to do it well

01:00.920 --> 01:01.680
Elder son

01:03.120 --> 01:05.560
Second son is more tactful than you

01:08.240 --> 01:08.800
Father

01:09.160 --> 01:10.560
Your son has a few questions

01:10.840 --> 01:11.640
To ask second brother
