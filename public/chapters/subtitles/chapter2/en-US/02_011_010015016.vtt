00:01.400 --> 00:02.480
This jade thumb ring is still here

00:06.480 --> 00:07.080
The Princess Consort truly has

00:07.080 --> 00:08.080
Foresight

00:09.520 --> 00:10.840
You scared me

00:11.040 --> 00:11.480
I thought

00:11.480 --> 00:13.160
You gave it away on a whim

00:13.400 --> 00:14.160
Now

00:14.640 --> 00:15.880
I feel confident

00:21.480 --> 00:22.040
A few people

00:22.720 --> 00:23.520
Move this inside

00:33.200 --> 00:34.400
Why did we stop here?

00:43.080 --> 00:43.960
Blocked ahead

00:44.200 --> 00:45.160
I'll clear a path

00:45.400 --> 00:45.840
No need

00:46.760 --> 00:47.640
Let's walk

00:50.200 --> 00:51.080
Prince of Ning

00:51.640 --> 00:52.400
General Zu

00:52.640 --> 00:53.400
Please come in

00:55.400 --> 00:56.760
Prince of Ning's meaning

00:56.880 --> 00:57.720
I understand

00:58.040 --> 00:59.160
If the general has difficulties

00:59.280 --> 01:00.760
In the capital or elsewhere

01:00.960 --> 01:02.600
You can directly send someone to inform me

01:02.720 --> 01:03.400
I will

01:03.600 --> 01:04.880
Do my utmost to help

01:05.400 --> 01:06.080
Thank you

01:06.080 --> 01:07.720
What a grand gesture

01:07.960 --> 01:09.080
Move faster

01:09.480 --> 01:10.720
Don't block others from coming and going

01:13.400 --> 01:14.480
Second brother is here too

01:14.720 --> 01:16.200
Greetings to Prince of Jin

01:17.080 --> 01:17.720
General Zu

01:18.520 --> 01:19.040
Elder brother

01:20.040 --> 01:20.640
Why

01:20.840 --> 01:21.880
Did you walk here yourself?

01:24.280 --> 01:25.600
I blocked the way ahead

01:25.960 --> 01:27.160
If you need to move things

01:27.320 --> 01:28.520
I'll have them help you move them

01:32.080 --> 01:33.280
This box

01:34.640 --> 01:36.160
Is the gift you prepared

01:37.080 --> 01:38.480
Minister Xie's treasured collection

01:39.080 --> 01:40.200
Previously, no matter what was said

01:40.200 --> 01:41.400
He wouldn't even let me touch it

01:42.040 --> 01:43.200
Hearing the general returned to the capital

01:43.480 --> 01:43.960
Here

01:44.400 --> 01:45.720
It came into my hands

01:46.400 --> 01:47.600
This jade thumb ring

01:47.720 --> 01:48.760
Is too valuable

01:49.200 --> 01:49.960
I, Zu

01:50.280 --> 01:51.520
Am afraid I cannot accept it
