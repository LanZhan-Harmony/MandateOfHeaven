00:02.000 --> 00:02.560
Father

00:02.840 --> 00:04.160
Your son's words come from the heart

00:04.440 --> 00:05.560
Please reconsider, Father

00:10.440 --> 00:11.200
Prince of Jin

00:11.320 --> 00:11.840
Please

00:29.400 --> 00:30.760
General, have compassion for me

00:31.040 --> 00:32.040
And also have compassion for

00:32.040 --> 00:33.240
The people in the south

00:33.960 --> 00:35.160
The matter of going north

00:35.320 --> 00:36.760
We will definitely fight

00:37.200 --> 00:38.800
But how about waiting a bit longer?

00:40.480 --> 00:41.840
Virtuous and wise

00:42.160 --> 00:43.600
None surpass Your Majesty

01:03.400 --> 01:05.400
Since you so want to go north

01:05.800 --> 01:07.480
I'll let you lead troops to fight

01:07.960 --> 01:09.080
If you don't win

01:09.280 --> 01:10.600
Don't come back to see me

01:12.160 --> 01:12.720
Your son

01:13.440 --> 01:14.080
Accepts the order

01:19.800 --> 01:21.320
In the nineteenth year of Yuankang

01:21.800 --> 01:24.080
Prince of Jin Sikong Yao led troops north

01:24.360 --> 01:26.760
Accidentally fell into heavy encirclement

01:28.800 --> 01:29.800
Men of Xuan Kingdom

01:30.080 --> 01:31.440
Do not accept the shame of capture

01:31.680 --> 01:32.240
Gentlemen

01:32.760 --> 01:34.000
Follow me in bloody battle

01:34.360 --> 01:35.440
Until death

01:37.280 --> 01:39.400
You fought the enemy until dusk

01:39.760 --> 01:41.800
In the end, you were outnumbered

01:41.880 --> 01:43.360
And died on the battlefield

01:43.920 --> 01:45.720
Emperor Xuan Sikong Jing heard the news

01:45.880 --> 01:47.040
Grieved deeply

01:47.160 --> 01:48.400
Could not eat or drink

01:48.960 --> 01:49.800
Not long after

01:49.920 --> 01:52.680
Made Sikong Zheng the crown prince
