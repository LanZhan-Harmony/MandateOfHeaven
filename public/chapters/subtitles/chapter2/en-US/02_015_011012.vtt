00:03.120 --> 00:03.720
Two people

00:04.000 --> 00:04.600
Move this inside

00:04.600 --> 00:05.000
Carefully

00:05.480 --> 00:06.200
Please come in

00:07.440 --> 00:08.200
Hurry

00:13.440 --> 00:14.840
Though the material is ordinary

00:15.360 --> 00:16.760
These improved stirrups

00:17.240 --> 00:18.360
Are quite rare

00:20.760 --> 00:21.760
Why did we stop here?

00:25.480 --> 00:26.840
General Zu rarely returns

00:26.880 --> 00:27.600
Let's hurry

00:30.120 --> 00:31.000
Blocked ahead

00:31.200 --> 00:32.120
I'll clear a path

00:32.240 --> 00:32.720
No need

00:33.440 --> 00:34.240
Let's walk

00:37.360 --> 00:38.240
Prince of Ning

00:38.600 --> 00:39.360
General Zu

00:39.440 --> 00:40.120
Please come in

00:42.120 --> 00:43.480
Prince of Ning's meaning

00:43.480 --> 00:44.480
I understand

00:44.680 --> 00:45.720
If the general has difficulties

00:45.840 --> 00:47.360
In the capital or elsewhere

00:47.600 --> 00:49.440
You can directly send someone to inform me

00:49.440 --> 00:51.600
I will do my utmost to help

00:51.960 --> 00:52.480
Thank you

00:52.680 --> 00:54.200
What a grand gesture

00:54.840 --> 00:55.960
Move faster

00:56.480 --> 00:57.720
Don't block others from coming and going

01:00.080 --> 01:01.240
Second brother is here too

01:01.360 --> 01:02.760
Greetings to Prince of Jin

01:03.600 --> 01:04.320
General Zu

01:05.080 --> 01:05.600
Elder brother

01:06.960 --> 01:07.480
Why

01:07.680 --> 01:08.960
Did you walk here yourself?

01:11.080 --> 01:12.360
I blocked the way ahead

01:12.840 --> 01:14.240
If you need to move things

01:14.480 --> 01:15.600
I'll have them help you move them

01:19.840 --> 01:20.840
This box

01:21.480 --> 01:22.960
Is the gift you prepared, right?
