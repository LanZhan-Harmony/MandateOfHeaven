00:07.320 --> 00:08.040
Your son believes

00:08.760 --> 00:09.600
The matter of going north

00:10.280 --> 00:11.320
Is not about money and grain

00:12.840 --> 00:13.840
But an attitude

00:14.840 --> 00:15.400
As the saying goes

00:15.920 --> 00:17.040
A king's enterprise does not rest in peace

00:17.280 --> 00:18.280
Traitors and the state cannot coexist

00:18.600 --> 00:19.400
If the land is lost

00:19.400 --> 00:20.480
It can still be recovered

00:21.080 --> 00:22.040
But if the people's hearts scatter

00:22.600 --> 00:23.920
To gather them again

00:24.520 --> 00:25.520
Will be difficult

00:25.840 --> 00:26.320
How dare you

00:27.400 --> 00:29.240
You're indirectly calling Father a coward

00:29.600 --> 00:30.320
Elder son

00:31.080 --> 00:32.440
Why are you in such a hurry?

00:32.560 --> 00:33.720
I said today

00:33.920 --> 00:35.440
Speak freely

00:38.440 --> 00:39.080
Father

00:39.720 --> 00:41.000
Your son has a few questions

00:41.440 --> 00:42.160
To ask second brother
