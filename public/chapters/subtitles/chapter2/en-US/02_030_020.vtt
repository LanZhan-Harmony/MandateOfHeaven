00:01.680 --> 00:02.160
Father

00:03.680 --> 00:04.760
The literary part

00:05.080 --> 00:05.880
Has been lively enough

00:06.840 --> 00:07.840
Why not have some martial arts?

00:08.160 --> 00:09.360
You're being wild

00:09.680 --> 00:10.240
No

00:10.360 --> 00:11.160
Once you get going

00:11.200 --> 00:12.000
You don't care about anything

00:12.080 --> 00:12.440
Alright

00:15.360 --> 00:16.480
I heard

00:16.920 --> 00:18.080
The martial arts in the capital

00:18.480 --> 00:19.720
Are quite impressive

00:20.560 --> 00:21.120
No less than

00:21.120 --> 00:22.680
Our border troops

00:23.480 --> 00:24.440
I wonder

00:25.160 --> 00:27.160
If there are any masters or heroes

00:28.360 --> 00:30.360
Willing to spar with me

00:30.840 --> 00:31.680
My second brother

00:31.760 --> 00:32.840
Has practiced martial arts since childhood

00:33.200 --> 00:34.440
And has studied

00:34.560 --> 00:35.400
Military techniques

00:36.120 --> 00:36.880
Why not

00:37.680 --> 00:40.080
Have General Zu Yue and second brother

00:40.160 --> 00:41.160
Spar

00:41.440 --> 00:42.840
As entertainment for the general

00:43.240 --> 00:43.840
How about it?

00:47.920 --> 00:48.720
Prince of Jin

00:49.000 --> 00:49.960
Last time we met

00:50.240 --> 00:51.320
I had a mission

00:51.840 --> 00:53.200
Mainly won because of numbers

00:53.760 --> 00:55.560
I truly didn't get to experience Your Highness's strength

00:56.080 --> 00:56.680
Today

00:56.880 --> 00:58.400
How about we have a one-on-one match?

00:58.920 --> 00:59.920
All past matters

01:00.560 --> 01:02.560
Your Highness can settle in the match
