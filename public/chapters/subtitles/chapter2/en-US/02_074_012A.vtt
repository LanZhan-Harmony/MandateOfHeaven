00:06.840 --> 00:08.400
Your Highness drinks so readily

00:08.840 --> 00:09.840
Aren't you afraid

00:10.080 --> 00:11.400
I put poison in this soup?

00:11.560 --> 00:12.600
If you wanted to poison me

00:12.920 --> 00:14.000
There are ten thousand ways

00:14.200 --> 00:15.680
Why bother bringing it to me yourself?

00:16.360 --> 00:17.840
The hangover soup has herbs added

00:18.920 --> 00:20.440
Tomorrow you won't have a hangover headache

00:44.600 --> 00:45.760
Thank you, sister

00:51.080 --> 00:52.520
The smell of alcohol is so strong

00:52.560 --> 00:53.520
It's overwhelming

00:55.720 --> 00:57.560
The food at other people's residences

00:57.840 --> 00:59.480
Is always better than home

01:00.840 --> 01:02.160
I'll learn from it later

01:02.400 --> 01:03.720
To add some freshness

01:04.040 --> 01:05.080
So no one will

01:05.080 --> 01:06.640
Worry that I'm starving you

01:07.040 --> 01:08.080
You manage the household

01:08.560 --> 01:10.880
Who would dare criticize you?

01:11.360 --> 01:12.280
Even if they don't say it

01:12.440 --> 01:13.920
They still worry in their hearts

01:14.080 --> 01:14.560
Let's go

01:14.960 --> 01:15.960
Rest early today

01:16.480 --> 01:18.080
You stay up all night reading documents

01:18.280 --> 01:20.280
That light keeps me from sleeping well

01:24.880 --> 01:26.160
Wan'er respectfully sees off Your Highness

01:26.440 --> 01:27.080
Princess Consort
