00:00.200 --> 00:02.000
Our dynasty governs with loyalty, filial piety, and ritual

00:02.520 --> 00:03.400
The people will certainly not

00:03.400 --> 00:05.040
Be like the northern barbarians

00:05.520 --> 00:06.200
Surely

00:06.520 --> 00:08.160
They will understand the court's good intentions

00:08.520 --> 00:09.200
And difficulties

00:11.280 --> 00:12.760
You speak so lightly

00:13.560 --> 00:14.120
Since ancient times

00:14.120 --> 00:15.320
Because they couldn't eat

00:15.600 --> 00:17.320
And rising in rebellion

00:17.520 --> 00:18.480
Are there not many examples?

00:18.840 --> 00:20.320
Could it be they never received

00:20.320 --> 00:21.920
The teachings of loyalty, filial piety, and ritual?

00:22.320 --> 00:24.240
Others talk strategy on paper

00:24.760 --> 00:26.600
You're governing with words
