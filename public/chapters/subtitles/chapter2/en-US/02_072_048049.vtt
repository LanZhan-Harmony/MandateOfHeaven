00:01.720 --> 00:02.680
Your Majesty, wait

00:03.920 --> 00:04.720
Just now

00:05.000 --> 00:06.120
Prince of Jin said

00:06.480 --> 00:07.760
To mobilize the entire nation's strength

00:08.120 --> 00:09.120
Your subject believes

00:09.280 --> 00:10.120
That's not necessary

00:10.760 --> 00:11.240
Your subject

00:11.400 --> 00:13.680
Can reduce the required horses and supplies

00:14.120 --> 00:15.320
To thirty percent

00:16.080 --> 00:17.800
And still go north

00:18.040 --> 00:18.920
Thirty percent

00:20.720 --> 00:22.560
That reduces the pressure considerably

00:22.560 --> 00:23.480
But your subject

00:23.720 --> 00:26.000
Boldly asks Your Majesty for one person

00:26.200 --> 00:26.720
Who?

00:28.880 --> 00:30.080
Prince of Jin

00:31.600 --> 00:32.360
Second son

00:39.680 --> 00:40.280
These words

00:40.480 --> 00:41.720
You've all heard

00:41.920 --> 00:43.360
What do you think?

00:44.640 --> 00:45.160
Your son

00:45.360 --> 00:46.480
Is willing to assist the general

00:47.080 --> 00:48.360
If after all this trouble

00:48.360 --> 00:50.280
We waste effort and money with no good result

00:50.920 --> 00:52.640
Watch your head

00:55.240 --> 00:55.800
Father

00:56.280 --> 00:57.200
Your son believes

00:57.400 --> 00:59.160
Sending second brother is a good thing

00:59.720 --> 01:00.400
If successful

01:00.640 --> 01:01.800
The credit goes to Father

01:02.160 --> 01:03.080
If we fail

01:03.200 --> 01:04.240
The credit goes to Father

01:04.720 --> 01:05.280
The blame is on

01:05.760 --> 01:06.400
Your son

01:08.720 --> 01:09.280
Enough

01:09.760 --> 01:11.680
All the unpleasant things have been said

01:11.880 --> 01:12.840
Let's be merry

01:13.200 --> 01:14.200
Continue the celebration

01:23.320 --> 01:23.920
Come

01:24.760 --> 01:26.080
Let's drink this cup together

01:35.480 --> 01:37.120
Everything is finally resolved

01:38.680 --> 01:40.040
With this opportunity to go north

01:40.880 --> 01:42.000
I can accumulate military achievements

01:42.680 --> 01:43.800
Bit by bit

01:44.480 --> 01:45.560
Turn the situation around

01:53.600 --> 01:54.720
I see Your Highness at the banquet

01:54.720 --> 01:55.880
Drank quite a bit

01:57.760 --> 01:59.120
Freshly warmed hangover soup
