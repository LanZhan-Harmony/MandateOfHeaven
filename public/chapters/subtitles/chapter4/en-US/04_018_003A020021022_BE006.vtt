00:01.880 --> 00:02.760
Notify the entire army

00:03.760 --> 00:04.600
Burn the granaries

00:06.880 --> 00:07.960
Abandon the city

00:10.400 --> 00:11.240
Retreat from the south

00:11.880 --> 00:12.400
Yes

00:14.320 --> 00:14.840
Let's go

00:24.880 --> 00:25.880
Bring torches

01:17.720 --> 01:19.240
You abandon Yiyang

01:19.360 --> 01:22.640
Retreating to the rear with a thousand remnants

01:23.400 --> 01:24.320
Soon after

01:24.320 --> 01:26.480
Wuyang also declared an emergency

01:27.360 --> 01:28.480
Supply routes cut

01:28.840 --> 01:32.520
Zu Kun could only abandon this northern expedition

01:39.000 --> 01:40.120
Months later

01:40.200 --> 01:41.360
You return to your residence

01:42.080 --> 01:42.720
However

01:43.080 --> 01:44.520
Because of the failed northern expedition

01:44.640 --> 01:46.000
You completely lost

01:46.000 --> 01:47.880
Your standing in court

01:48.840 --> 01:51.720
Under Prince of Ning and the Chen family's constant schemes

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
You eventually made a grave mistake

01:54.120 --> 01:56.320
And were demoted to commoner by the emperor

01:56.960 --> 01:59.200
Exiled to the Eastern Sea
