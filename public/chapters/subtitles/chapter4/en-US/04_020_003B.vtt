WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:02.600
No

00:03.480 --> 00:04.520
We absolutely cannot retreat

00:05.640 --> 00:07.400
We can be heroes and fulfill our duty

00:08.240 --> 00:10.000
But what about my sister and the heir?

00:10.640 --> 00:11.480
Brother-in-law

00:13.640 --> 00:15.720
General Zu entrusted this important city to me

00:16.000 --> 00:17.360
All soldiers are fighting to the death

00:18.160 --> 00:18.760
The volunteers

00:18.760 --> 00:20.040
Don't even spare their lives for this land

00:21.640 --> 00:23.000
How can I retreat?

00:23.640 --> 00:25.120
Anyone who dares speak of retreat

00:25.880 --> 00:27.480
Will be executed for desertion

00:33.040 --> 00:34.000
The Wuzhao commit their main force

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
Fighting on two fronts

00:35.760 --> 00:37.040
Their center must be weak

00:37.640 --> 00:38.040
Look

00:40.520 --> 00:41.240
His command flag

00:41.240 --> 00:42.520
Is on the slope to the northwest

00:44.600 --> 00:45.440
We can strike

00:45.440 --> 00:46.240
Shilang's lair

00:49.240 --> 00:50.240
Xie Xuan, receive orders

00:52.040 --> 00:52.920
Your general is here

00:53.440 --> 00:54.200
I order you

00:55.240 --> 00:56.680
To hold the granaries to the death

00:58.960 --> 00:59.520
No

00:59.760 --> 01:00.720
If we're fighting to the death

01:01.040 --> 01:02.480
I won't be such a coward

01:03.800 --> 01:04.440
No

01:05.240 --> 01:06.520
The granaries absolutely cannot fall into

01:06.520 --> 01:07.400
Wuzhao hands

01:08.240 --> 01:08.920
Your Highness

01:09.760 --> 01:10.600
Let us do it

01:19.720 --> 01:20.280
Your Highness

01:20.720 --> 01:21.760
I've brought all who can move

01:21.800 --> 01:22.800
Here

01:23.160 --> 01:24.560
Everyone is willing to follow Your Highness

01:25.000 --> 01:26.040
Leave this to us

01:26.280 --> 01:27.000
I promise

01:28.160 --> 01:29.240
If the city falls

01:29.760 --> 01:30.240
The Wuzhao

01:30.840 --> 01:31.320
Won't take

01:31.320 --> 01:32.160
A single grain

01:33.600 --> 01:35.560
Willing to die for the royal army

01:36.200 --> 01:38.400
Willing to advance and retreat with the royal army

01:38.600 --> 01:40.600
Willing to die for the royal army

01:40.920 --> 01:43.080
Willing to advance and retreat with the royal army

01:45.520 --> 01:46.320
Today

01:47.240 --> 01:48.440
You all entrust your lives to me

01:49.280 --> 01:50.480
If I don't die today

01:52.280 --> 01:53.680
I will grant you all

01:55.160 --> 01:56.520
To return home in glory

01:57.800 --> 01:58.760
Those who cannot fight

01:58.920 --> 01:59.840
Stand on the granaries

02:01.160 --> 02:02.200
Raise torches

02:03.240 --> 02:04.080
If I am defeated

02:05.680 --> 02:06.800
Light the fires and burn the granaries

02:12.520 --> 02:13.160
Those who can fight

02:13.480 --> 02:14.920
Follow me into the enemy camp

02:30.760 --> 02:31.840
Mount up
