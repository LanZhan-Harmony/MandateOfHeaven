WEBVTT

00:04.640 --> 00:05.920
This matter, listen to Xie Xuan

00:07.400 --> 00:09.040
If Shilang's army really wants to retreat

00:09.520 --> 00:10.920
Why go to such lengths

00:11.240 --> 00:12.240
To block information

00:12.680 --> 00:14.240
Not even a carrier pigeon can enter

00:15.120 --> 00:16.600
Now we're cornered

00:17.240 --> 00:18.360
And completely blind

00:18.600 --> 00:19.320
At this time

00:19.640 --> 00:21.080
We're most likely to become gamblers

00:22.040 --> 00:22.800
The more so

00:23.480 --> 00:24.240
The less we should move

00:26.800 --> 00:27.840
Hurry to repair the walls

00:28.800 --> 00:29.200
Yes

00:30.080 --> 00:30.480
Xie Xuan

00:31.080 --> 00:31.760
General Liu

00:31.920 --> 00:33.360
Continue adding internal defenses

00:33.920 --> 00:34.240
Yes

00:34.320 --> 00:34.640
Yes

01:02.480 --> 01:03.720
No movement in the city yet

01:05.280 --> 01:06.040
Reporting, General

01:06.240 --> 01:06.960
Not yet

01:07.280 --> 01:08.240
That coward Prince of Jin

01:08.240 --> 01:09.520
Is as timid as a mouse

01:09.600 --> 01:10.520
Scared by the general

01:10.520 --> 01:11.480
Won't move a step

01:12.920 --> 01:13.400
General

01:14.520 --> 01:15.600
Chanyu Ayidai these past days

01:15.800 --> 01:16.920
Has been sending messages asking

01:17.400 --> 01:18.920
If we don't take Yiyang soon

01:19.160 --> 01:20.400
Hurry, hurry, hurry

01:20.600 --> 01:21.960
Hurry your mother

01:24.600 --> 01:26.040
Prince of Jin Sikong Yao

01:27.040 --> 01:28.600
I'll remember this

01:30.520 --> 01:31.240
Return to camp

01:32.040 --> 01:32.960
Tell the other side

01:33.160 --> 01:34.160
To prepare for me

01:37.600 --> 01:38.040
Report

01:40.520 --> 01:41.840
No activity found in the south

01:44.720 --> 01:45.160
Report

01:45.960 --> 01:47.280
No activity found in the west

01:51.400 --> 01:52.640
Could they really have withdrawn?

02:04.720 --> 02:05.360
What's going on?

02:05.360 --> 02:06.080
Report

02:06.160 --> 02:06.720
Urgent report

02:06.800 --> 02:07.720
Urgent report from the west

02:07.920 --> 02:09.400
The Wuzhao have broken in from the west

02:10.600 --> 02:11.600
Into the city

02:11.800 --> 02:13.080
How could they enter the city?

02:13.280 --> 02:14.040
Don't panic yet

02:14.520 --> 02:15.640
What's the situation in the west now?

02:15.640 --> 02:16.480
I've been hearing

02:16.720 --> 02:17.840
Sounds these past days

02:17.840 --> 02:18.480
I've been

02:18.480 --> 02:19.640
Resting poorly lately

02:19.960 --> 02:20.720
Always hearing

02:20.720 --> 02:21.840
Tapping sounds

02:22.600 --> 02:23.240
Always dreaming

02:23.240 --> 02:24.960
Of Wuzhao horses trampling me

02:25.400 --> 02:26.960
I thought it was hallucinations

02:27.280 --> 02:28.040
Now I know

02:28.280 --> 02:29.960
The Wuzhao dug tunnels

02:30.000 --> 02:31.400
Undermining the wall foundations

02:31.560 --> 02:32.480
The Wuzhao elite

02:32.560 --> 02:33.800
Have already emerged from the tunnels

02:33.800 --> 02:34.560
Taking the gates

02:34.800 --> 02:36.480
General Liu is holding with his men

02:39.600 --> 02:40.280
Report

02:40.920 --> 02:42.360
The Wuzhao army from the north has turned back

02:42.680 --> 02:43.600
Preparing to attack the city

02:44.560 --> 02:45.240
The north

02:45.240 --> 02:46.600
Many volunteers at the west gate

02:46.600 --> 02:47.680
If they defect

02:47.720 --> 02:48.480
I'm afraid we can't hold

02:48.480 --> 02:49.800
Yes, we can't hold

02:49.800 --> 02:51.040
This is fighting on two fronts

02:51.160 --> 02:52.160
But we have so few men

02:52.160 --> 02:52.720
Right

02:53.040 --> 02:53.840
How can we defend?

02:53.840 --> 02:54.840
We simply can't hold

02:56.040 --> 02:56.720
Don't panic

02:58.240 --> 02:58.920
Everyone

02:59.120 --> 02:59.920
Reinforce the north

03:00.120 --> 03:00.960
The northern front

03:01.600 --> 03:02.720
Will be commanded by General Zhu

03:03.160 --> 03:04.480
Bring all available equipment

03:04.480 --> 03:05.720
Must stop the Wuzhao main force

03:06.480 --> 03:07.600
I accept the order

03:08.120 --> 03:08.680
You all

03:08.800 --> 03:09.480
Follow me

03:09.480 --> 03:09.960
Yes

03:15.720 --> 03:16.280
Xie Xuan

03:17.040 --> 03:17.800
Your general is here
