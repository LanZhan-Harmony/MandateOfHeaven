WEBVTT

00:03.880 --> 00:05.120
Today we serve the state

00:05.920 --> 00:06.920
You all and I

00:08.360 --> 00:09.640
Will be recorded in history

00:10.400 --> 00:11.720
For all eternity

00:12.120 --> 00:13.240
Immortalized in history

00:16.000 --> 00:17.400
Reclaim our land

00:17.920 --> 00:19.560
The royal army will triumph

00:19.640 --> 00:21.240
Reclaim our land

00:21.360 --> 00:22.760
The royal army will triumph

00:22.840 --> 00:24.400
Reclaim our land

00:24.400 --> 00:26.680
The royal army will triumph

Reclaim our land

00:27.680 --> 00:30.160
Kill

00:30.560 --> 00:32.080
Reclaim our land

00:32.240 --> 00:33.960
The royal army will triumph

00:34.240 --> 00:35.760
Reclaim our land

00:35.960 --> 00:37.680
The royal army will triumph

Reclaim our land

00:39.840 --> 00:41.640
The royal army will triumph

01:19.880 --> 01:20.920
No retreat

01:21.680 --> 01:23.400
Anyone who retreats, I'll kill

01:25.120 --> 01:27.680
Kill

01:50.920 --> 01:51.640
Old Liu

01:52.760 --> 01:53.640
The gates

01:54.400 --> 01:56.000
The gates can't hold much longer

01:56.400 --> 01:57.640
Can't hold

01:58.080 --> 02:00.000
Then don't hold them

02:02.160 --> 02:03.760
Yiyang is in danger

02:04.920 --> 02:06.400
Those unwilling to follow me

02:06.560 --> 02:07.760
Break out on your own

02:07.760 --> 02:08.920
Find another way

02:09.960 --> 02:10.720
Back then

02:11.400 --> 02:12.960
Defending Yong'an

02:13.840 --> 02:15.120
I ran

02:16.080 --> 02:16.760
This time

02:17.200 --> 02:18.680
I'm not running

02:19.960 --> 02:20.920
That Prince of Jin

02:21.360 --> 02:22.760
Is still reliable

02:23.360 --> 02:24.240
Great Xuan

02:24.560 --> 02:26.840
Still recognizes us northern Xuan people

02:27.160 --> 02:28.720
Those who want revenge

02:30.000 --> 02:31.840
Follow me and form ranks

02:32.560 --> 02:34.240
Prepare to charge

02:36.080 --> 02:38.240
Only one order

02:38.400 --> 02:39.960
At all costs

02:40.840 --> 02:42.400
Hold until sunset

02:44.640 --> 02:45.440
Old brother

02:45.920 --> 02:47.680
Beat the drums for me

02:48.720 --> 02:49.960
All troops

02:50.400 --> 02:51.080
Listen

02:51.920 --> 02:53.000
To orders

02:54.160 --> 02:55.120

02:55.120 --> 02:56.200

03:30.120 --> 03:31.760
Kill

03:32.680 --> 03:35.600
Kill

03:43.960 --> 03:45.680
A pack of stray dogs

03:46.200 --> 03:47.760
Must have taken the wrong medicine

03:48.680 --> 03:50.320
Send three more battalions

03:50.920 --> 03:51.920
Hurry to breach the city

03:52.160 --> 03:52.640
Yes

03:53.000 --> 03:53.240

03:58.440 --> 03:58.920
General

03:59.080 --> 04:00.080
A unit of Xuan cavalry

04:00.160 --> 04:00.720
Has charged in

04:00.720 --> 04:01.440
What?

04:03.320 --> 04:04.400
Take all our men

04:04.680 --> 04:05.960
Must stop them

04:07.160 --> 04:07.560
Yes

04:07.680 --> 04:08.240
Go

04:08.680 --> 04:09.160
Hurry

04:21.560 --> 04:22.920
Clear the way for Your Highness

04:39.880 --> 04:40.960
Bandit

04:41.880 --> 04:43.440
Your head is mine
