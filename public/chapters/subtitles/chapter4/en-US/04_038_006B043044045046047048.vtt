WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:02.600
A nobody

00:03.040 --> 00:04.080
Not worth mentioning

00:04.920 --> 00:06.760
I'll remember your face

00:07.080 --> 00:07.840
Retreat

00:24.400 --> 00:25.080
Brothers

00:25.400 --> 00:26.320
Pursue with all our might

00:26.520 --> 00:27.400
Leave none alive

00:27.600 --> 00:28.240
Wait

00:29.280 --> 00:29.840
Chen Ying

00:30.120 --> 00:30.960
You still want to stop us?

00:31.520 --> 00:32.480
I've already given you all my military merit

00:32.480 --> 00:33.480
Completely

00:33.800 --> 00:34.840
You dare go back on your word

00:34.840 --> 00:35.480
General Zu

00:35.960 --> 00:37.960
I only promised to hold Yiyang

00:38.120 --> 00:39.920
Pursuing the Wuzhao is too risky

00:40.280 --> 00:41.120
All soldiers

00:42.120 --> 00:43.480
The Wuzhao trampled the central plains

00:43.920 --> 00:44.920
Oppressed our people

00:45.320 --> 00:46.920
If we let the Wuzhao return north

00:47.440 --> 00:48.480
Next time those who suffer

00:49.160 --> 00:50.640
May be your families

00:51.080 --> 00:51.800
And friends

00:52.640 --> 00:53.840
Sons of Xuan

00:54.400 --> 00:56.000
How can we endure such humiliation?

00:56.600 --> 00:57.520
Northern volunteers

00:57.840 --> 00:59.280
Still dare to fight to the death

00:59.920 --> 01:00.600
Those with courage

01:01.240 --> 01:02.160
Follow me and kill

01:02.280 --> 01:03.040
Without my order

01:03.240 --> 01:04.000
No one moves

01:07.520 --> 01:09.040
Kill

01:12.960 --> 01:15.080
Kill

01:32.480 --> 01:33.800
The sun sets

01:34.560 --> 01:36.400
Liu Dadao, at some point

01:36.520 --> 01:38.560
Was pierced by a spear

01:38.920 --> 01:41.640
Kneeling backward in the sunset

01:42.920 --> 01:44.120
On both sides of him

01:44.560 --> 01:46.960
Xuan's iron cavalry thundered past

01:47.560 --> 01:49.760
He gazed at the pink sky

01:49.960 --> 01:52.600
Finally released the blade in his hand

01:54.160 --> 01:55.480
Facing death

01:55.480 --> 01:56.760
Who isn't afraid?

01:56.960 --> 01:58.480
Who isn't a coward?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.840
But there are always some beliefs

02:02.400 --> 02:03.680
That can support

02:04.040 --> 02:06.160
A coward's backbone

02:13.040 --> 02:14.040
Liu

02:16.840 --> 02:17.680
Liu

02:18.120 --> 02:19.960
Liu Nian

02:19.960 --> 02:21.360
I, Sikong Yao, swear

02:22.360 --> 02:23.360
I will protect her

02:23.800 --> 02:24.760
Warm clothes and full bellies

02:25.480 --> 02:26.480
Peace and happiness

02:30.000 --> 02:30.840
General Liu

02:32.480 --> 02:33.480
You and the brothers

02:35.120 --> 02:36.360
Rest assured

03:21.760 --> 03:22.960
The imperial physicians said

03:23.120 --> 03:24.960
Not to get too emotional

03:25.520 --> 03:26.480
Your head condition

03:26.560 --> 03:27.760
Needs rest

03:28.040 --> 03:28.960
Those physicians

03:28.960 --> 03:29.880
Know nothing

03:30.400 --> 03:31.800
The Daoist masters said

03:32.080 --> 03:33.960
Three disasters, nine hardships, ten trials

03:34.320 --> 03:36.840
Must pass through to achieve immortality

03:51.320 --> 03:52.000
Born

03:52.000 --> 03:52.840
Born

03:53.400 --> 03:54.080
How is it?

03:54.240 --> 03:55.080
Congratulations, Your Majesty

03:55.280 --> 03:56.120
Congratulations, Empress

03:56.320 --> 03:57.320
It's a son

03:58.960 --> 03:59.480
Good

03:59.880 --> 04:01.400
I will richly reward the Xie family

04:01.880 --> 04:02.320
Let's go

04:02.520 --> 04:03.920
I want to see my grandson

04:10.080 --> 04:10.560
Look at him

04:10.560 --> 04:12.120
He's smiling, he's smiling

04:13.600 --> 04:14.440
His eyes

04:14.600 --> 04:15.520
Are like his father's

04:16.240 --> 04:17.360
His nose

04:17.640 --> 04:18.760
Takes after me

04:21.760 --> 04:22.880
This is the eldest grandson

04:23.080 --> 04:25.400
Your Majesty should give him a name

04:26.240 --> 04:26.960
Good

04:28.040 --> 04:28.960
Sheng

04:29.640 --> 04:30.520
Call him

04:30.840 --> 04:32.440
Sikong Sheng

04:33.960 --> 04:35.120
Father is wise

04:35.920 --> 04:36.480
Sheng

04:36.960 --> 04:38.880
Is for the great victory in the north

04:39.440 --> 04:40.960
Is for the north-south canal

04:41.080 --> 04:43.000
Soon to be opened for prosperity

04:43.880 --> 04:45.240
Is from heaven

04:45.600 --> 04:48.160
Blessing Great Xuan's flourishing fortune

04:50.040 --> 04:50.600
We

04:50.600 --> 04:52.000
Have a good daughter-in-law

04:54.960 --> 04:55.600
Sheng'er

04:55.680 --> 04:56.320
Sheng'er

04:56.400 --> 04:57.120
Sheng'er
