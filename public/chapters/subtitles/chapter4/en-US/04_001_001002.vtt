00:06.720 --> 00:07.160
Here

00:07.480 --> 00:08.800
These inconspicuous places in the city

00:08.800 --> 00:09.960
Can all have ambushes set

00:10.160 --> 00:11.400
If street fighting breaks out

00:11.560 --> 00:13.240
Can greatly slow the enemy's advance

00:15.000 --> 00:15.520
Report

00:16.840 --> 00:17.520
The Wuzhao

00:17.520 --> 00:18.520
The Wuzhao have withdrawn

00:19.000 --> 00:19.840
Withdrawn

00:20.040 --> 00:20.840
How is that possible?

00:20.960 --> 00:21.680
Absolutely true

00:21.680 --> 00:22.480
Their army has already

00:22.480 --> 00:23.280
Started moving

00:25.320 --> 00:25.680
Let's go

00:26.000 --> 00:26.640
To see

00:37.880 --> 00:38.600
Could it be

00:38.600 --> 00:40.320
Our volunteers have come to help

00:40.640 --> 00:42.360
Shilang thinks Yiyang

00:42.360 --> 00:43.640
Is a tough nut to crack

00:43.960 --> 00:45.640
And is preparing to attack elsewhere

00:46.640 --> 00:47.000
No

00:48.080 --> 00:49.120
More likely

00:49.880 --> 00:50.600
Reinforcements have arrived

00:51.320 --> 00:52.200
Shilang

00:52.320 --> 00:53.440
Plans to besiege and attack reinforcements

00:53.760 --> 00:55.280
The Wuzhao made no moves yesterday

00:55.960 --> 00:56.520
Perhaps

00:56.520 --> 00:57.360
They were planning

00:57.440 --> 00:58.280
To turn their spears

00:58.360 --> 00:59.520
To fully attack the reinforcements

01:00.640 --> 01:01.760
Any news of reinforcements lately?

01:02.080 --> 01:03.200
The scouts we sent out

01:03.680 --> 01:04.680
None have returned

01:07.480 --> 01:08.120
Your Highness

01:08.760 --> 01:09.760
The reinforcements are rushing

01:09.920 --> 01:11.120
Likely can't maintain formation

01:11.400 --> 01:12.480
If they engage on the plains now

01:12.640 --> 01:14.200
Rushing into battle with Wuzhao cavalry

01:14.560 --> 01:16.120
I'm afraid they won't survive two charges

01:16.320 --> 01:17.480
And will be completely routed

01:20.000 --> 01:20.920
Your general requests to fight

01:21.120 --> 01:22.200
If we go out now

01:22.200 --> 01:23.040
And form with the reinforcements

01:23.040 --> 01:23.840
A pincer attack

01:23.920 --> 01:24.840
Then we have a chance

01:25.120 --> 01:26.200
What if reinforcements haven't come?

01:26.760 --> 01:28.200
Aren't you just delivering us to Shilang?

01:30.760 --> 01:32.040
The cooking fires in the Wuzhao camp

01:32.200 --> 01:33.280
Haven't decreased

01:34.000 --> 01:35.400
If they really plan to leave

01:35.760 --> 01:36.680
Why light fires?

01:38.040 --> 01:39.120
This is just a diversion

01:39.760 --> 01:41.280
Should we wait for them to destroy the reinforcements

01:41.680 --> 01:43.040
Then return to rest and attack the city?

01:43.200 --> 01:43.640
You

01:45.120 --> 01:46.280
Please, Your Highness, decide
