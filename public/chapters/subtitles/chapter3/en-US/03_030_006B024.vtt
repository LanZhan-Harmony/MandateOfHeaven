00:00.280 --> 00:01.080
What nonsense

00:01.600 --> 00:02.520
The imperial seal

00:02.720 --> 00:04.240
Has always been in the Sikong family's hands

00:05.040 --> 00:05.800
Go back and tell Shilang

00:06.440 --> 00:07.760
If he's willing to bare his back and carry thorns

00:08.320 --> 00:09.600
And surrender to Great Xuan

00:10.840 --> 00:11.960
I might

00:11.960 --> 00:12.800
Bring out the seal

00:13.520 --> 00:14.480
To show him

00:14.920 --> 00:15.440
Your Highness

00:15.680 --> 00:17.120
Why go this far?

00:17.280 --> 00:17.760
Throw them out

00:18.960 --> 00:19.760
Your Highness

00:20.120 --> 00:22.120
General Shilang really has the seal

00:22.120 --> 00:22.920
Your Highness

00:24.320 --> 00:25.840
Shilang's words that disrupt our morale

00:26.440 --> 00:27.360
Whoever spreads them

00:27.960 --> 00:28.800
Will face military law

00:29.000 --> 00:29.560
Yes

00:59.480 --> 01:00.440
General

01:01.920 --> 01:02.480
General

01:02.760 --> 01:03.200
General

01:03.560 --> 01:05.240
What exactly did Prince of Jin say?

01:05.520 --> 01:06.320
Just tell the truth

01:06.920 --> 01:08.280
Don't underestimate my magnanimity

01:12.520 --> 01:13.520
General

01:13.800 --> 01:14.280
He

01:15.760 --> 01:16.200
Said

01:17.000 --> 01:18.360
If the general is willing

01:19.200 --> 01:20.200
To bare his back and carry thorns

01:21.520 --> 01:22.480
And surrender to Great Xuan

01:23.600 --> 01:24.600
He's willing to bring

01:25.120 --> 01:25.760
The real thing

01:26.760 --> 01:27.920
To show you

01:32.040 --> 01:33.760
I'm always fair in rewards and punishments

01:34.280 --> 01:35.360
Since the job was botched

01:36.600 --> 01:37.520
Drag him behind a horse

01:38.040 --> 01:38.960
Three times around the city

01:39.720 --> 01:40.040
Yes

01:40.320 --> 01:40.760
No!

01:40.760 --> 01:41.040
General

01:41.480 --> 01:42.480
Spare me, General

01:42.920 --> 01:43.480
Spare my life

01:43.480 --> 01:44.040
General

01:44.760 --> 01:45.960
General, spare my life

01:58.920 --> 01:59.680
You Xuan people

02:00.240 --> 02:01.080
Are just useless

02:02.240 --> 02:02.720
General

02:03.120 --> 02:03.440
General

02:03.760 --> 02:04.480
There's another plan

02:05.080 --> 02:05.720
As I know

02:06.320 --> 02:07.480
The Wuyang commander Chen Ying

02:07.680 --> 02:08.120
Is backed by

02:08.680 --> 02:09.320
Xuan Kingdom's Prince of Ning

02:09.560 --> 02:10.320
Who doesn't get along with Prince of Jin

02:11.120 --> 02:13.360
We can spread the false news that Prince of Jin got the seal

02:13.360 --> 02:14.080
To

02:14.520 --> 02:15.040
Wuyang

02:17.440 --> 02:18.120
Good dog

02:18.440 --> 02:19.040
Good dog

02:19.800 --> 02:20.520
You'll be rewarded

02:21.240 --> 02:21.760
Thank you, General

02:22.040 --> 02:22.680
Thank you, General

02:22.680 --> 02:23.240
Do as he says

02:24.040 --> 02:25.680
Also have those who came line up

02:26.120 --> 02:26.480
Yes
