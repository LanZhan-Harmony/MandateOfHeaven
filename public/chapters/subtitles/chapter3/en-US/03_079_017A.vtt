00:00.680 --> 00:01.400
This melody

00:02.080 --> 00:02.680
Is very sad

00:05.400 --> 00:07.160
This is for the dead below the walls

00:07.960 --> 00:10.880
Learned from the granny with the best musical skill in the fort

00:12.280 --> 00:13.040
They say

00:13.160 --> 00:13.960
This melody

00:14.600 --> 00:15.720
Can soothe the departed

00:17.040 --> 00:18.080
Actually, I think

00:18.600 --> 00:20.040
What really needs soothing

00:20.600 --> 00:22.080
Isn't the departed

00:24.720 --> 00:25.760
In our Shitou Fortress

00:26.440 --> 00:28.640
People often use the time of one melody

00:29.680 --> 00:30.760
To say goodbye

00:31.200 --> 00:32.160
To grieve

00:32.640 --> 00:33.360
To remember

00:35.200 --> 00:37.040
Then quickly forget the pain

00:38.480 --> 00:39.840
To live on properly

00:41.520 --> 00:42.480
Why follow the volunteers

00:42.600 --> 00:43.640
To a dangerous place like Yiyang?

00:46.480 --> 00:47.880
Grandfather is my only family

00:48.440 --> 00:49.160
If I don't follow him

00:49.760 --> 00:50.640
Where else can I go?
