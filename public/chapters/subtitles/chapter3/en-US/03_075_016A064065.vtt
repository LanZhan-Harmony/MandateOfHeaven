WEBVTT

00:00.400 --> 00:01.040
Please, Commander Liu

00:01.800 --> 00:02.480
Order the volunteers

00:03.000 --> 00:04.400
To prepare an assault on the Wuzhao camp

00:05.280 --> 00:05.720
Those unwilling to fight

00:06.520 --> 00:07.240
Are spies

00:07.840 --> 00:09.640
Isn't this a bit arbitrary?

00:12.640 --> 00:14.000
If they don't dare fight the Wuzhao

00:14.400 --> 00:15.040
Then these people

00:15.400 --> 00:16.240
Why would they want to enter the city?

00:19.760 --> 00:20.520
I understand

00:29.000 --> 00:29.600
What do you mean?

00:30.640 --> 00:31.680
First you won't let us in

00:32.240 --> 00:33.720
Now you want us to be the vanguard

00:33.720 --> 00:34.520
To die

00:34.840 --> 00:35.320
Damn it

00:35.440 --> 00:36.440
I won't take this insult

00:37.920 --> 00:39.040
We brothers rushed here

00:39.240 --> 00:41.040
To fight the Wuzhao

00:41.280 --> 00:41.720
Old Liu

00:42.040 --> 00:43.000
Don't try to smooth things over

00:43.680 --> 00:44.760
Those bastards in Yiyang

00:45.160 --> 00:46.200
I'm done serving them

00:46.720 --> 00:46.920
Let's go

00:47.360 --> 00:47.680
Go

00:47.840 --> 00:48.040
You

00:49.760 --> 00:50.480
Go

00:55.400 --> 00:55.920
Your Highness

00:57.960 --> 00:58.880
Those unwilling to fight

00:59.320 --> 01:00.480
Have all left with their men

01:02.320 --> 01:03.240
The remaining

01:03.800 --> 01:04.720
Follow me into the city

01:05.280 --> 01:05.920
Yes
