WEBVTT

00:20.200 --> 00:20.840
During the day

00:21.000 --> 00:23.080
I saw these two standing on Yiyang's city walls

00:23.440 --> 00:24.240
They're not enemies

00:25.280 --> 00:26.120
You two

00:26.480 --> 00:28.120
Why are you dressed like this?

00:31.400 --> 00:32.000
Confidential

00:32.160 --> 00:32.680
I understand

00:33.440 --> 00:34.160
I am the commander

00:34.240 --> 00:35.240
Liu Dadao's granddaughter

00:35.480 --> 00:36.200
I'm Liu Nian

00:36.800 --> 00:37.560
This is Uncle Qiu

00:38.000 --> 00:39.160
Grandfather's capable deputy

00:41.760 --> 00:43.320
Yiyang garrison deputy general Xie Xuan

00:44.120 --> 00:45.120
By my general's orders

00:45.560 --> 00:46.680
Come to discuss with General Liu

00:47.120 --> 00:48.120
The matter of volunteers entering in groups

00:48.120 --> 00:48.920
Specific details

00:50.640 --> 00:51.120
Follow me

00:51.520 --> 00:52.680
I'll take you to see grandfather

01:04.320 --> 01:04.840
Those two

01:05.000 --> 01:05.800
One of them said

01:06.160 --> 01:07.680
He's the Yiyang garrison deputy general

01:08.040 --> 01:08.840
The other didn't mention

01:09.240 --> 01:10.400
But I think something's off

01:10.960 --> 01:11.560
What's off?

01:12.160 --> 01:13.960
Didn't I treat everyone's

01:13.960 --> 01:15.400
Frostbite on hands and feet?

01:15.560 --> 01:16.480
His hands

01:16.520 --> 01:17.760
Look different from ours

01:18.600 --> 01:19.120
What?

01:19.720 --> 01:21.200
He has six fingers

01:34.640 --> 01:36.600
Your general pays respects to Prince of Jin

01:37.840 --> 01:38.520
Grandfather

01:43.520 --> 01:43.920
Pay

01:44.440 --> 01:45.200
Respects to Your Highness

01:45.840 --> 01:46.440
Commander Liu

01:47.400 --> 01:48.960
Why would I need to hide

01:48.960 --> 01:49.720
To come out and see you?

01:50.440 --> 01:51.040
Do you understand

01:51.640 --> 01:52.040
This

01:52.640 --> 01:53.080
This

01:53.720 --> 01:54.520
In the volunteer army

01:54.640 --> 01:55.760
There are many eyes

01:56.080 --> 01:57.240
A force of nearly ten thousand

01:58.440 --> 01:59.080
Can you guarantee

01:59.080 --> 02:00.760
You know each person's background?

02:01.960 --> 02:02.920
In this volunteer army

02:03.040 --> 02:04.600
There's more than just my group

02:04.760 --> 02:06.320
Everyone just came together temporarily

02:06.640 --> 02:07.280
So

02:07.280 --> 02:08.600
I cannot let you into the city

02:11.560 --> 02:12.200
If in the volunteer army

02:12.920 --> 02:14.120
There are Wuzhao spies

02:14.120 --> 02:14.800
Taking advantage of the chaos

02:15.440 --> 02:17.080
Once they enter and cause Yiyang to fall

02:17.080 --> 02:18.040
The northern expedition fails

02:18.440 --> 02:19.080
Liu Dadao

02:20.400 --> 02:21.680
You who came from afar

02:21.680 --> 02:22.520
Noble volunteers

02:22.800 --> 02:24.040
Will all become eternal sinners

02:25.520 --> 02:26.120
Your Highness

02:26.240 --> 02:26.640
This

02:31.040 --> 02:32.440
I naturally trust Commander Liu

02:32.960 --> 02:33.800
But I'm also afraid Commander Liu

02:34.400 --> 02:35.520
Will misunderstand my intentions

02:36.120 --> 02:37.280
That's why I specifically risked

02:37.280 --> 02:38.040
Hiding my identity

02:38.200 --> 02:39.480
To explain to Commander Liu

02:40.160 --> 02:41.800
And discuss a solution

02:46.280 --> 02:46.720
Rise

03:20.600 --> 03:21.560
Your Highness's concerns

03:21.800 --> 03:22.680
I understand

03:23.760 --> 03:24.960
But Your Highness says

03:25.040 --> 03:26.960
There may be spies among my brothers

03:27.680 --> 03:29.120
What's the evidence?
