00:18.680 --> 00:19.120
Brother-in-law

00:21.240 --> 00:23.200
Can't let everyone's morale keep falling like this

00:25.280 --> 00:26.080
We need to take a gamble

00:30.640 --> 00:31.480
Night raid

00:32.360 --> 00:33.280
Night raid

00:35.480 --> 00:36.360
I bet Shilang

00:36.960 --> 00:38.280
Doesn't take us seriously enough yet

00:39.080 --> 00:39.840
Bet he won't expect

00:40.600 --> 00:42.200
That we'd dare in this situation

00:42.360 --> 00:43.360
To raid his main camp

00:48.400 --> 00:49.360
That's a plan

00:49.800 --> 00:52.000
Although the enemy has ten times our forces

00:52.200 --> 00:53.000
But facing a surprise attack

00:53.800 --> 00:55.200
They'll actually struggle with deployment

00:55.640 --> 00:56.280
And be unable to respond in time

00:56.920 --> 00:57.800
The key to a raid

00:58.560 --> 00:59.880
Is to avoid the enemy's main force

01:04.960 --> 01:06.240
The Wuzhao drove refugees to attack the city

01:06.240 --> 01:07.000
That evening

01:07.640 --> 01:08.560
I saw the eastern enemy camp

01:08.960 --> 01:10.160
Rising smoke early

01:10.800 --> 01:11.720
While the western enemy camp

01:12.320 --> 01:13.400
Is near the river

01:14.280 --> 01:14.720
Brother-in-law

01:15.280 --> 01:16.240
Where do you think the enemy's main force

01:16.880 --> 01:18.120
Should be hiding?

01:19.120 --> 01:20.640
Looking at the Wuzhao's camp arrangement

01:21.600 --> 01:22.720
The main force should be
