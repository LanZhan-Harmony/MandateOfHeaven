WEBVTT

00:10.880 --> 00:11.240
You

00:11.920 --> 00:12.480
Come with me

00:13.480 --> 00:14.120
You two

00:15.000 --> 00:15.760
Hand over your weapons

00:15.960 --> 00:16.720
Follow my soldiers

00:19.120 --> 00:19.800
Of course, of course

00:20.040 --> 00:22.280
We will follow the general's orders

00:23.880 --> 00:24.400
Mount up

00:33.720 --> 00:34.240
Your Highness

00:35.240 --> 00:36.720
General Shilang already knows

00:37.120 --> 00:38.320
That this time the Xuan army went north

00:38.720 --> 00:39.240
Was

00:39.480 --> 00:41.560
Promoted entirely by Prince of Jin

00:41.960 --> 00:42.720
For Prince of Jin

00:42.880 --> 00:44.000
To have such courage

00:44.240 --> 00:45.240
He deeply admires

00:45.720 --> 00:46.400
Saying Your Highness

00:46.560 --> 00:46.960
In the future

00:47.040 --> 00:48.680
Will surely be Xuan Kingdom's new ruler

00:49.120 --> 00:49.800
General Shilang

00:49.960 --> 00:51.480
Wishes to befriend Your Highness

00:51.960 --> 00:52.880
Both sides cease fighting

00:53.280 --> 00:54.760
And each gets what they need, how about it?

00:57.160 --> 00:57.960
Then tell me

00:58.720 --> 00:59.760
What does Shilang need?

01:00.200 --> 01:01.240
And what do I need?

01:01.720 --> 01:02.560
General Shilang

01:02.880 --> 01:03.680
Is willing to give

01:03.960 --> 01:04.920
Yiyang City

01:05.240 --> 01:06.480
To Your Highness

01:06.960 --> 01:07.320
But

01:07.680 --> 01:09.040
When Your Highness ascends the throne

01:09.640 --> 01:10.400
Please appoint

01:10.480 --> 01:11.560
General Shilang

01:11.960 --> 01:13.240
As Prince Zhenbei

01:13.480 --> 01:14.960
And grant the prosperous land of Qing Province

01:15.240 --> 01:16.240
As his domain

01:16.480 --> 01:17.320
What a deal

01:18.400 --> 01:19.640
To trade our Xuan city

01:20.240 --> 01:21.320
For our Xuan province

01:22.440 --> 01:23.800
General, please don't be angry

01:24.040 --> 01:25.280
Let me finish speaking

01:25.720 --> 01:26.520
That year

01:26.720 --> 01:27.800
General Shilang

01:28.120 --> 01:29.560
Was the first to enter Yong'an

01:30.040 --> 01:31.280
By chance

01:31.920 --> 01:33.720
He obtained a great treasure

01:38.040 --> 01:38.720
This treasure

01:39.000 --> 01:40.280
Green as blue in color

01:40.480 --> 01:41.480
Smooth and square

01:41.720 --> 01:42.720
With a jade chi-tiger knob

01:43.480 --> 01:44.960
Is precisely our Xuan Kingdom's

01:45.440 --> 01:46.960
Imperial seal

01:47.480 --> 01:48.040
What?

01:48.480 --> 01:48.960
How could that be?

01:48.960 --> 01:50.960
What a reversal of truth

01:51.800 --> 01:52.720
Invading our country

01:53.120 --> 01:54.760
Is said to be entering Yong'an

01:55.120 --> 01:56.280
Massacring the entire court

01:56.560 --> 01:57.480
Stealing the seal

01:58.640 --> 02:00.000
Is said to be by chance

02:00.000 --> 02:01.320
Obtaining a great treasure

02:02.520 --> 02:03.720
You, a Xuan person

02:04.440 --> 02:06.040
Acting as a dog under the enemy

02:06.560 --> 02:08.000
Dare to speak nonsense

02:08.680 --> 02:09.560
Believe it or not

02:09.880 --> 02:11.160
I'll kill you right now

02:11.920 --> 02:12.480
Your Highness

02:12.760 --> 02:13.720
This official wouldn't dare

02:14.200 --> 02:15.040
This official absolutely wouldn't dare

02:15.040 --> 02:16.400
To risk my own head

02:16.400 --> 02:17.120
As a joke

02:18.440 --> 02:19.400
If Your Highness is interested

02:19.960 --> 02:21.200
You can wait until tonight

02:21.920 --> 02:22.480
The seal

02:22.760 --> 02:24.200
Will be sent into the city
