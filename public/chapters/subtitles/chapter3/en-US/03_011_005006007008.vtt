WEBVTT

00:06.040 --> 00:07.680
I am Prince of Jin Sikong Yao of Great Xuan

00:08.560 --> 00:09.360
I promise you all

00:10.000 --> 00:10.920
Great Xuan has never for a day

00:10.920 --> 00:12.040
Forgotten the people of the north

00:13.320 --> 00:13.680
The royal army

00:13.680 --> 00:14.800
Will surely recover the homeland

00:15.800 --> 00:16.680
Return to everyone

00:17.000 --> 00:17.920
A peaceful realm

00:19.480 --> 00:20.560
How wonderful

00:22.120 --> 00:23.360
Great Xuan hasn't forgotten us

00:24.120 --> 00:25.680
The royal army has finally come, Your Highness

00:26.040 --> 00:26.800
Let's hurry on our way

00:28.680 --> 00:29.320
Military duties call

00:29.920 --> 00:30.560
Cannot stay long

00:41.440 --> 00:41.800
For you

00:52.360 --> 00:53.040
Continue on our way

00:55.560 --> 00:56.160
In September

00:56.880 --> 00:58.040
Xuan Kingdom's great army

00:58.040 --> 00:59.000
Crossed the Tianhe

00:59.000 --> 01:00.160
Went fully north

01:01.000 --> 01:02.360
The northern regions heard the news

01:02.600 --> 01:04.160
And opened their gates to welcome

01:04.560 --> 01:06.800
Righteous armies also rose in response

01:07.560 --> 01:09.000
To pave the way for the returning royal army

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
They

01:10.240 --> 01:11.240
Did not fear death

01:11.480 --> 01:13.000
And spared no cost

01:13.360 --> 01:14.160
Therefore

01:14.240 --> 01:16.560
All armies quickly followed the plan

01:16.600 --> 01:18.800
And occupied all strategic locations

01:20.000 --> 01:20.320
However

01:20.320 --> 01:21.120
Two months later

01:21.560 --> 01:23.040
The Wutu organized a great army

01:23.160 --> 01:24.560
Divided into three routes going south

01:24.800 --> 01:26.040
Quickly retook

01:26.040 --> 01:27.040
Some cities

01:27.880 --> 01:28.880
Any city that opened its gates

01:28.880 --> 01:29.920
To welcome the Xuan army

01:30.160 --> 01:32.480
Was completely massacred

01:54.240 --> 01:55.040
The Wutu great army

01:55.800 --> 01:56.240
From the east

01:56.360 --> 01:56.560
West

01:56.680 --> 01:56.920
North

01:57.240 --> 01:58.000
Surrounded the city on three sides

01:58.560 --> 01:59.480
According to scouts' reports

02:00.000 --> 02:00.440
They brought

02:00.440 --> 02:01.000
A craftsmen camp

02:01.440 --> 02:02.560
To build rams on site

02:02.800 --> 02:03.320
Catapults

02:04.240 --> 02:05.440
They probably won't attack immediately

02:07.360 --> 02:07.680
Report

02:09.120 --> 02:09.440
General

02:09.680 --> 02:10.360
Military report has arrived

02:11.040 --> 02:11.240
Let's go

02:11.880 --> 02:12.360
Back to the council hall

02:18.040 --> 02:18.680
This military report

02:19.040 --> 02:20.360
Is already three days old

02:20.800 --> 02:21.360
The Wutu Great Chanyu

02:21.920 --> 02:22.320
Ayidai

02:22.680 --> 02:24.120
Personally leads one hundred thirty thousand infantry and cavalry

02:24.480 --> 02:25.240
Toward General Zu Kun

02:25.240 --> 02:26.360
Who garrisons Xingyang

02:26.800 --> 02:27.360
Right General

02:27.800 --> 02:28.160
Ayigu

02:28.480 --> 02:29.240
Leads twenty thousand cavalry

02:29.240 --> 02:30.160
To intercept Zu Yue's forces

02:31.000 --> 02:31.880
Surrounding us now

02:32.240 --> 02:33.360
Is Left General Shilang

02:33.360 --> 02:34.320
Leading fifty thousand tribesmen
