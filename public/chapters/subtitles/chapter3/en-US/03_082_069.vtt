00:00.800 --> 00:02.000
Though it's unorthodox

00:02.560 --> 00:03.360
But

00:03.880 --> 00:05.040
I know quite a bit of medicine

00:05.560 --> 00:07.080
Anyone under grandfather with injuries or illness

00:07.520 --> 00:08.560
I handle them all

00:19.320 --> 00:19.760
Tonight

00:20.840 --> 00:22.360
The Wuzhao camp is brightly lit

00:23.240 --> 00:24.440
They must be planning strategy

00:25.120 --> 00:26.760
I'm afraid they'll launch a major attack tomorrow

00:31.880 --> 00:32.640
Aren't you afraid?

00:34.800 --> 00:36.480
Xuan people in the north

00:37.000 --> 00:38.040
What is there to fear?

00:39.440 --> 00:39.960
Perhaps

00:41.160 --> 00:41.960
The only fear

00:42.360 --> 00:43.400
Is that one day

00:43.880 --> 00:45.560
We no longer believe we are Xuan people
