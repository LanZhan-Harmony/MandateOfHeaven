00:00.480 --> 00:01.360
It is I

00:05.120 --> 00:06.520
This official Chu Maolun

00:06.880 --> 00:08.520
Pays respects to Prince of Jin

00:12.600 --> 00:13.600
A dog by the horse

00:14.200 --> 00:15.360
How dare you call yourself a Xuan official?

00:16.480 --> 00:16.880
Your subject

00:17.640 --> 00:18.200
No

00:19.240 --> 00:21.120
This foreign official once served in Xuan Kingdom

00:21.400 --> 00:22.760
As prefect of Shuoyang Prefecture

00:23.360 --> 00:24.240
This area around Yiyang

00:24.480 --> 00:26.280
Was once under this foreign official's jurisdiction

00:26.760 --> 00:28.480
This foreign official heard that Prince of Jin

00:28.480 --> 00:29.880
Led the royal army north

00:30.640 --> 00:31.960
Today I risk death to come

00:32.480 --> 00:33.840
To offer Prince of Jin

00:34.080 --> 00:36.080
A strategy to lift the siege of Yiyang

00:36.600 --> 00:37.200
I hope

00:37.200 --> 00:38.760
Your Highness will permit this foreign official and others

00:39.000 --> 00:40.240
To enter the city for detailed discussion
