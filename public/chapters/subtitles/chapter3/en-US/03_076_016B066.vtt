WEBVTT

00:00.280 --> 00:01.160
Since we can't catch them

00:01.960 --> 00:02.800
Then don't catch them

00:04.600 --> 00:05.480
Break up the volunteers

00:05.880 --> 00:06.840
Integrate them into the garrison

00:07.480 --> 00:09.560
Have officers of battalion rank and above take charge

00:10.080 --> 00:10.840
So spies

00:11.280 --> 00:11.800
Have no way

00:11.800 --> 00:13.000
To organize together as units

00:13.480 --> 00:14.400
Add more personnel

00:14.560 --> 00:15.360
Strictly guard the gates

00:16.320 --> 00:17.280
Should be safe

00:20.000 --> 00:20.560
Your Highness

00:21.160 --> 00:22.960
Having everyone hand over their command

00:23.480 --> 00:25.160
My men are fine with it

00:26.240 --> 00:27.480
But other leaders

00:28.400 --> 00:29.840
May not agree

00:30.440 --> 00:31.080
This matter

00:31.680 --> 00:32.880
Relies on Commander Liu

00:33.080 --> 00:33.880
Please, Commander Liu

00:34.200 --> 00:35.400
Give the brothers advance notice

00:35.960 --> 00:36.680
When my men arrive

00:37.440 --> 00:38.680
To arrange entry

00:39.200 --> 00:39.760
Set an example

00:42.920 --> 00:43.520
Leaders

00:44.280 --> 00:44.960
Hesitation is normal

00:45.680 --> 00:46.280
But the hesitant

00:46.960 --> 00:48.400
Often follow the loudest voice

00:50.760 --> 00:53.280
What if someone absolutely refuses?

00:55.680 --> 00:56.240
Then please

00:57.480 --> 00:58.680
Turn back

01:02.480 --> 01:02.880
Yes

01:20.480 --> 01:21.080
Damn it

01:21.160 --> 01:22.160
I won't take this insult

01:22.480 --> 01:23.560
We brothers rushed here

01:23.840 --> 01:24.240
Isn't it

01:24.240 --> 01:25.760
To fight the Wuzhao?

01:26.000 --> 01:26.440
Old Liu

01:26.880 --> 01:27.960
You can fool everyone

01:28.400 --> 01:29.480
But don't fool yourself

01:30.320 --> 01:32.280
Everyone said to get benefits together

01:33.080 --> 01:34.320
You didn't take more for yourself, did you?

01:34.320 --> 01:34.840
No

01:34.920 --> 01:36.200
Those bastards in Yiyang

01:36.400 --> 01:37.160
I'm done serving them

01:37.600 --> 01:38.040
Let's go

01:38.680 --> 01:39.040
You

01:39.520 --> 01:39.800
You all

01:40.840 --> 01:41.600
Go
