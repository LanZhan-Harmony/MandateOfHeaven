00:00.600 --> 00:02.400
Regarding the Wutu's commander Shilang this time

00:03.320 --> 00:03.920
Do you know anything about him?

00:04.560 --> 00:05.840
Heard from General Zu

00:06.280 --> 00:06.680
This man

00:06.840 --> 00:08.440
Is one of Wutu Zhao's renowned fierce generals

00:09.200 --> 00:10.160
When Yong'an fell that year

00:10.680 --> 00:11.680
He led only dozens of cavalry

00:11.680 --> 00:12.440
Charged into the city

00:13.400 --> 00:14.920
Single-handedly made tens of thousands of defenders

00:15.200 --> 00:15.920
Tremble and flee

00:16.800 --> 00:17.440
In recent years

00:17.800 --> 00:18.800
He has had few defeats

00:19.200 --> 00:19.560
However

00:20.200 --> 00:20.800
This Shilang

00:21.080 --> 00:21.720
Despite this

00:21.720 --> 00:22.400
With illustrious military achievements

00:22.920 --> 00:23.400
Now

00:23.840 --> 00:25.040
Is only a Left General

00:25.560 --> 00:26.680
All because his mother

00:27.200 --> 00:28.920
Was a captured Xuan woman slave

00:29.400 --> 00:30.560
Making his origins lowly

00:30.920 --> 00:31.800
In the Wutu Zhao court

00:32.080 --> 00:33.200
He is suppressed everywhere

00:33.840 --> 00:35.040
That can only make him

00:35.080 --> 00:36.080
More cunning

00:36.960 --> 00:37.680
Because he

00:38.400 --> 00:39.080
Cannot afford mistakes
