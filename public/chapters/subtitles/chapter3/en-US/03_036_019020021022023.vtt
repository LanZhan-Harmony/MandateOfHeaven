00:27.240 --> 00:27.640
General

00:27.960 --> 00:28.680
General Shilang

00:29.160 --> 00:30.920
Everything in the city has been arranged

00:31.160 --> 00:32.480
There are agents in the city to assist

00:32.880 --> 00:33.640
The northern garrison

00:33.760 --> 00:35.000
Most are already dead drunk

00:35.880 --> 00:36.520
Two warriors

00:36.720 --> 00:38.040
Will open the city gates soon

00:38.240 --> 00:39.360
To welcome the general into the city

00:40.480 --> 00:41.200
Good dog

00:41.960 --> 00:42.640
Good dog

00:43.920 --> 00:44.720
You'll be rewarded

00:45.360 --> 00:46.120
Thank you, General

00:47.440 --> 00:47.920
Prepare the army

00:48.800 --> 00:49.960
Ready for the assault

00:50.600 --> 00:51.000
Yes

00:51.720 --> 00:52.120
General

00:52.280 --> 00:52.760
General

00:53.800 --> 00:54.240
Your subordinate

00:54.520 --> 00:55.200
For the general

00:55.240 --> 00:56.440
Would naturally die a thousand deaths

00:57.160 --> 00:57.480
But

00:58.000 --> 00:59.120
Could you release my

00:59.360 --> 01:01.040
Wife and daughter first?

01:02.280 --> 01:02.760
Of course

01:03.120 --> 01:04.440
I'll not only release them

01:05.160 --> 01:06.760
But also have a dozen Wuzhao warriors

01:07.120 --> 01:08.160
Take good care of them

01:11.960 --> 01:13.040
General, count me in

01:13.400 --> 01:14.120
Count me in too

01:14.120 --> 01:14.640
Good

01:35.280 --> 01:36.400
Courageous

01:36.920 --> 01:37.480
Shilang

01:38.440 --> 01:39.720
You're a beast

01:51.160 --> 01:52.400
You beast

01:59.480 --> 02:00.200
Xuan people

02:00.600 --> 02:02.400
A bunch of soft worms in the dirt

02:03.600 --> 02:04.480
Wuzhao warriors

02:05.600 --> 02:06.720
Who dares to be the vanguard?

02:07.160 --> 02:07.520
I will

02:09.200 --> 02:09.600
Good

02:10.360 --> 02:11.200
I'll give you a unit

02:11.480 --> 02:12.480
Break the city today

02:12.920 --> 02:13.320
Yes

02:43.720 --> 02:44.400
The gates are moving

02:45.800 --> 02:46.360
Brothers

02:46.760 --> 02:47.600
Follow me in the charge

02:48.000 --> 02:48.800
Gold, silver, and treasures

02:49.240 --> 02:50.120
We'll take first

03:04.400 --> 03:05.000
Why are there people

03:05.640 --> 03:06.240
Something's not right

03:17.000 --> 03:17.680
We've been tricked

03:20.720 --> 03:21.840
Fire arrows

03:25.760 --> 03:26.640
The enemy is trapped

03:27.120 --> 03:28.000
Kill

03:45.120 --> 03:45.640
Report

03:45.960 --> 03:46.480
General

03:46.960 --> 03:48.000
The troops we just sent out

03:48.440 --> 03:49.200
Have been completely wiped out

03:49.480 --> 03:49.960
What?

03:51.360 --> 03:52.440
Everyone, speak up

03:52.680 --> 03:53.680
What should we do?

04:05.720 --> 04:06.280
General

04:06.960 --> 04:07.920
Perhaps Prince of Jin

04:08.400 --> 04:09.720
Saw through our plan

04:10.200 --> 04:10.960
And turned it against us

04:12.520 --> 04:13.640
Do you think I'm blind?

04:16.360 --> 04:17.120
Call them back

04:18.120 --> 04:18.800
General, calm your anger

04:19.160 --> 04:19.720
General, calm your anger

04:20.200 --> 04:20.720
This plan

04:21.160 --> 04:21.960
Isn't a complete failure yet

04:22.520 --> 04:23.360
As I know

04:23.720 --> 04:25.200
The Wuyang commander Chen Ying

04:25.760 --> 04:26.360
Is backed by

04:26.760 --> 04:27.720
Xuan Kingdom's Prince of Ning

04:28.400 --> 04:29.400
Who doesn't get along with Prince of Jin

04:29.920 --> 04:30.880
We can spread the false news that Prince of Jin

04:31.040 --> 04:32.280
Got the seal

04:33.040 --> 04:34.280
To Wuyang

04:36.160 --> 04:37.360
You Xuan people

04:37.360 --> 04:38.160
Understand Xuan people

04:40.440 --> 04:41.280
Do as he says

04:41.760 --> 04:42.160
Also

04:42.640 --> 04:43.720
Have those who came line up

04:44.040 --> 04:44.440
Yes
