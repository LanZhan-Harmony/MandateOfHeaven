00:01.240 --> 00:02.160
Have the requests for aid been sent?

00:02.720 --> 00:03.280
Already sent to

00:03.480 --> 00:03.960
General Zu Yue

00:04.360 --> 00:06.120
And General Chen Ying

00:06.720 --> 00:07.720
Sent out over twenty

00:07.720 --> 00:08.360
Light cavalry from the city

00:09.600 --> 00:10.160
Should

00:10.600 --> 00:11.720
At least some messages will get through

00:12.560 --> 00:14.800
Wutu cavalry are strong in field battles

00:15.600 --> 00:16.160
Zu Yue's army

00:16.480 --> 00:17.480
If they cannot repel Ayigu

00:17.920 --> 00:19.360
Will find it very difficult to send troops to support us

00:20.120 --> 00:21.360
General Zu Kun connected Wuyang

00:21.560 --> 00:21.920
And Yiyang

00:22.160 --> 00:22.920
Into a line

00:23.680 --> 00:24.320
Precisely to

00:24.440 --> 00:25.440
Deal with this situation

00:25.920 --> 00:26.920
So now we

00:27.320 --> 00:28.880
Can only rely on Wuyang

00:29.680 --> 00:30.800
Rely on Chen Ying
