00:00.800 --> 00:01.720
When we were outside the city

00:03.120 --> 00:03.760
Thank you, miss

00:05.360 --> 00:06.800
When grandfather immediately knelt

00:07.080 --> 00:08.600
It really startled me

00:09.840 --> 00:10.480
Your Highness

00:11.080 --> 00:13.000
Have you been standing here long?

00:14.400 --> 00:15.240
The melody is beautiful

00:16.240 --> 00:16.960
Can you play another?

00:17.640 --> 00:17.880
Mm

01:10.400 --> 01:11.160
This melody

01:11.800 --> 01:13.040
Is warmer than the last

01:15.960 --> 01:16.800
The previous one

01:17.160 --> 01:18.400
Was for the departed

01:19.040 --> 01:19.840
This one

01:20.120 --> 01:21.280
Is for Your Highness

01:21.920 --> 01:23.160
Even someone made of iron

01:23.560 --> 01:25.280
Needs to rest sometimes

01:26.560 --> 01:27.760
After hearing your two melodies

01:28.440 --> 01:28.880
I feel much better

01:33.040 --> 01:33.800
I see you, miss

01:34.600 --> 01:35.320
Don't know martial arts

01:35.880 --> 01:36.760
Why follow the volunteers

01:36.760 --> 01:37.920
To a dangerous place like Yiyang?

01:39.520 --> 01:40.960
Grandfather is my only family

01:41.400 --> 01:42.280
If I don't follow him

01:42.760 --> 01:43.720
Where else can I go?
