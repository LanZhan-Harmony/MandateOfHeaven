00:00.320 --> 00:01.120
What nonsense

00:01.560 --> 00:02.520
The imperial seal

00:02.800 --> 00:04.520
Has always been in the Sikong family's hands

00:05.120 --> 00:06.280
Although by convention

00:06.720 --> 00:08.080
Envoys are not killed in war

00:09.280 --> 00:11.080
But such malicious words

00:11.680 --> 00:12.520
I cannot spare you

00:14.120 --> 00:14.680
Zhu Yuanzhi

00:14.760 --> 00:15.040
Here

00:15.760 --> 00:16.800
Cut off his head

00:18.240 --> 00:19.120
Throw it back to Shilang

00:19.720 --> 00:20.000
Yes

00:21.240 --> 00:21.680
Drag him away

00:22.600 --> 00:23.120
Your Highness

00:23.280 --> 00:23.800
Your Highness

00:24.040 --> 00:25.880
Shilang really has the imperial seal

00:25.880 --> 00:26.960
Your Highness

00:54.800 --> 00:55.280
General

00:57.480 --> 00:58.560
This is Chu Maolun's head

01:16.760 --> 01:18.040
Any other Xuan tricks

01:18.040 --> 01:18.840
You're used to

01:19.560 --> 01:20.280
Think harder

01:21.000 --> 01:21.480
Or

01:21.720 --> 01:22.800
Say your last words now

01:23.960 --> 01:24.440
General

01:24.720 --> 01:25.200
General

01:25.520 --> 01:26.200
There's another plan

01:26.800 --> 01:27.560
As I know

01:28.120 --> 01:29.280
The Wuyang commander Chen Ying

01:29.480 --> 01:30.000
Is backed by

01:30.360 --> 01:31.120
Xuan Kingdom's Prince of Ning

01:31.280 --> 01:32.040
Who doesn't get along with Prince of Jin

01:32.680 --> 01:34.240
We can spread the false news that Prince of Jin

01:34.440 --> 01:35.760
Got the seal

01:36.040 --> 01:36.520
To

01:37.080 --> 01:37.840
Wuyang

01:39.080 --> 01:39.800
Good dog

01:40.280 --> 01:41.000
Good dog

01:41.520 --> 01:42.240
You'll be rewarded

01:43.000 --> 01:43.520
Thank you, General

01:43.800 --> 01:44.360
Thank you, General

01:44.360 --> 01:45.040
Do as he says

01:45.760 --> 01:47.360
Also have those who came line up

01:47.520 --> 01:47.800
Yes
