WEBVTT

00:35.640 --> 00:36.000
General

00:36.360 --> 00:37.000
They retreated too quickly

00:37.480 --> 00:38.040
Didn't catch them all

00:41.040 --> 00:42.000
Prince of Jin

00:42.760 --> 00:44.000
That rabbit emperor in the south

00:44.480 --> 00:45.960
Has raised a wolf

00:47.400 --> 00:48.960
Just lost some tents

00:49.280 --> 00:50.680
General Shi's fifty thousand troops

00:51.080 --> 00:51.960
No matter how he schemes

00:52.120 --> 00:52.640
It's just

00:53.000 --> 00:54.200
A breeze brushing fur

00:54.480 --> 00:55.400
What do you know?

00:56.560 --> 00:57.520
When two armies fight

00:58.120 --> 00:59.160
It's all about momentum

01:00.640 --> 01:01.480
The Xuan people's arrows

01:01.480 --> 01:03.400
Have almost all been used on the refugees

01:04.120 --> 01:04.680
Call the craftsmen

01:05.040 --> 01:06.040
The finished catapults

01:06.920 --> 01:07.400
At dawn

01:07.520 --> 01:08.320
Send two units

01:08.640 --> 01:09.320
To attack the city in rotation

01:09.680 --> 01:10.360
On the other side

01:10.600 --> 01:11.640
Work faster too

01:12.120 --> 01:12.360
Yes

01:21.280 --> 01:21.920
Send people out of the city

01:22.480 --> 01:23.360
To recover arrows as much as possible

01:23.840 --> 01:24.200
At the same time

01:24.640 --> 01:25.640
Open the southern grain storehouse

01:26.120 --> 01:27.480
Reward our troops for the successful raid

01:28.160 --> 01:28.800
Have the soldiers

01:29.480 --> 01:30.040
Celebrate together

01:31.480 --> 01:31.880
Yes

01:35.600 --> 01:36.160
This General Zhu

01:36.480 --> 01:37.440
Truly has the courage of a bear and tiger

01:37.760 --> 01:38.840
I saw in the Wuzhao camp

01:39.000 --> 01:39.680
Flames reaching the sky

01:40.080 --> 01:40.640
Truly satisfying

01:41.040 --> 01:41.480
Pity

01:41.880 --> 01:42.480
Only good food

01:42.840 --> 01:43.360
No wine

01:44.200 --> 01:44.640
I think

01:45.000 --> 01:45.880
This meal is like a last meal

01:46.400 --> 01:47.560
Zhu Yuanzhi showed off

01:48.400 --> 01:49.200
Won't the Wuzhao retaliate?

01:49.960 --> 01:51.120
Maybe they'll launch a full attack tonight

01:51.560 --> 01:52.080
Lately I

01:52.960 --> 01:53.760
Can't sleep well

01:54.000 --> 01:54.600
Always hear

01:54.680 --> 01:55.400
Thumping sounds

01:56.480 --> 01:57.800
Always dream of Wuzhao warhorses

01:57.840 --> 01:58.600
Trampling down on me

01:59.400 --> 02:00.000
Shut up and eat

02:00.760 --> 02:01.360
Stop thinking about this and that

02:01.480 --> 02:02.120
Scaring yourself

02:14.960 --> 02:15.640
Although we've repelled the enemy

02:16.600 --> 02:17.600
But arrows are exhausted

02:18.320 --> 02:20.000
All kinds of weapons and traps

02:20.480 --> 02:21.280
Are also severely depleted

02:22.040 --> 02:22.360
Also

02:22.680 --> 02:23.760
Need to immediately assign people

02:24.280 --> 02:25.200
To urgently repair the city walls

02:26.920 --> 02:27.600
How many men do we have left?

02:28.120 --> 02:29.000
Heavy casualties

02:29.040 --> 02:30.920
Now only about two thousand can still fight

02:31.480 --> 02:32.360
If the Wuzhao attack again

02:32.560 --> 02:33.360
At most we can

02:34.280 --> 02:35.000
Hold for two days

02:35.480 --> 02:36.040
Report

02:37.920 --> 02:38.680
There's an army to the south

02:38.680 --> 02:39.560
Approaching us

02:40.000 --> 02:41.280
They don't look like Wuzhao

02:42.000 --> 02:43.200
Chen Ying's reinforcements have arrived

02:44.480 --> 02:45.960
Let's go take a look

03:06.880 --> 03:08.400
Who goes there?

03:10.360 --> 03:11.840
I'm Liu Dadao

03:12.080 --> 03:14.320
Commander of Yong'an Garrison's Left Army

03:15.200 --> 03:16.000
These

03:16.360 --> 03:18.800
Are all the lords of northern fortresses

03:19.360 --> 03:20.320
Zhang, Huang, Liu, Li

03:20.400 --> 03:21.360
The four great families

03:21.520 --> 03:22.880
Have also come

03:23.280 --> 03:24.280
Although we're in the north

03:24.760 --> 03:25.440
In our hearts

03:25.840 --> 03:27.520
We always recognize the Xuan on this flag

03:28.680 --> 03:31.120
Everyone heard the royal army is trapped in Yiyang

03:31.840 --> 03:33.520
Specially led the northern volunteer army

03:33.880 --> 03:34.840
To come and help

03:39.480 --> 03:40.680
Great Xuan's old subjects

03:40.880 --> 03:42.440
Great Xuan's old subjects

03:42.640 --> 03:44.640
Willing to die for Great Xuan

03:44.760 --> 03:47.000
Willing to die for Great Xuan

03:47.200 --> 03:47.680
It's reinforcements

03:48.280 --> 03:49.040
Our reinforcements

03:52.600 --> 03:53.000
Your Highness

03:53.560 --> 03:54.160
Look
