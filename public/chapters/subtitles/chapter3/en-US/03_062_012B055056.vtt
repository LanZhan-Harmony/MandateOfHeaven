00:00.440 --> 00:01.040
Have the volunteers

00:01.880 --> 00:02.440
Camp outside the city for now

00:03.320 --> 00:03.760
Your Highness

00:04.720 --> 00:05.960
This is cautious

00:06.720 --> 00:07.800
But may chill their hearts

00:10.160 --> 00:11.120
Look at their flags

00:12.040 --> 00:13.520
There are several fortresses alone

00:14.800 --> 00:15.840
This is a mixed bag

00:16.760 --> 00:18.240
Can't guarantee there are no Wuzhao spies

00:19.480 --> 00:21.000
They only need to organize a hundred people

00:21.640 --> 00:22.520
To cause chaos in the city

00:23.760 --> 00:24.960
Then seize the gates

00:25.960 --> 00:26.840
And we're finished

00:29.480 --> 00:30.160
What's the delay?

00:30.920 --> 00:31.760
Let us in

00:31.840 --> 00:33.840
Yes, yes, yes

00:34.160 --> 00:34.560
Brother-in-law

00:35.440 --> 00:36.280
These northern volunteers

00:36.560 --> 00:38.280
Are mostly bandits in daily life

00:39.040 --> 00:40.760
Their tempers are worse than each other

00:41.520 --> 00:42.720
Few are presentable

00:43.840 --> 00:44.480
If we don't reassure them

00:45.440 --> 00:46.800
They'll probably turn around and leave
