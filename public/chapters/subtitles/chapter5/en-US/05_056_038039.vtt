00:00.600 --> 00:01.440
Brother-in-law, be careful

00:07.040 --> 00:07.760
Return to camp and organize troops

00:07.880 --> 00:08.440
Attack the city

00:09.680 --> 00:10.240
Retreat

00:17.240 --> 00:18.280
Can't delay any longer

00:18.280 --> 00:19.880
Dongming has long resisted attack

00:19.960 --> 00:21.840
Qingzhou Army presses from behind

00:22.520 --> 00:23.800
I've discovered

00:23.800 --> 00:25.560
Someone is communicating with the court

00:25.640 --> 00:28.120
Wanting to defect to protect their families

00:28.320 --> 00:29.880
If this continues

00:30.240 --> 00:31.880
Morale will be in danger

00:32.080 --> 00:32.760
One day

00:33.240 --> 00:34.400
Give me one more day

00:34.600 --> 00:36.160
I'll personally lead the battle

00:36.440 --> 00:37.440
Will surely take the city

00:37.800 --> 00:39.920
Dongming is now impregnable

00:40.240 --> 00:41.760
Your reckless bravery

00:41.760 --> 00:44.240
Will only cause heavy losses

00:47.520 --> 00:48.240
Your Highness

00:48.560 --> 00:50.280
It's the rainy season now

00:50.840 --> 00:52.440
Tianhe water level has surged

00:52.640 --> 00:55.520
If we breach the Nanshui dike

00:55.600 --> 00:56.880
And flood the city

00:57.120 --> 00:59.040
Then Dongming within one day

00:59.040 --> 00:59.840
Will fall

00:59.960 --> 01:00.760
Father

01:01.160 --> 01:02.400
Breaching the dike

01:02.560 --> 01:03.440
In this city

01:03.440 --> 01:05.880
And tens of thousands of surrounding people, will they survive?

01:06.320 --> 01:07.880
They are all Xuan's subjects

01:08.280 --> 01:09.720
They are innocent

01:11.960 --> 01:12.880
Child

01:13.320 --> 01:14.560
Remember

01:14.720 --> 01:16.240
To achieve great things

01:16.520 --> 01:17.920
Some sacrifice

01:18.600 --> 01:20.240
Is unavoidable

01:20.840 --> 01:23.880
Even if we don't care about those people's lives

01:24.240 --> 01:26.720
We must still consider Your Highness's reputation

01:30.440 --> 01:32.080
Say no more

01:32.120 --> 01:34.400
Since Your Highness raised troops at Yiyang

01:34.680 --> 01:35.200
We

01:35.200 --> 01:38.280
Have already been rebels in the historians' records

01:40.400 --> 01:41.240
Your Highness

01:41.560 --> 01:43.040
Make a decision
