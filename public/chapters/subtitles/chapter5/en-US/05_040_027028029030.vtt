00:07.680 --> 00:08.560
Who rebelled?

00:08.560 --> 00:09.920
How can a dead man rebel?

00:10.080 --> 00:11.040
The news is true

00:11.160 --> 00:12.080
Previous letters

00:12.120 --> 00:14.160
Seem to have been written by someone imitating General Chen

00:14.360 --> 00:16.920
I'm afraid General Chen was already beheaded and his head used as a banner

00:20.920 --> 00:21.880
Chancellor Chen

00:24.880 --> 00:25.840
Ying'er

00:34.480 --> 00:37.200
Immediately order Qingzhou Army to advance at full speed

00:37.720 --> 00:39.080
Destroy the rebels

00:39.640 --> 00:41.240
Avenge my son

00:41.520 --> 00:42.120
Yes

00:45.560 --> 00:46.560
Ying'er

00:49.000 --> 00:51.920
Ying'er

01:06.920 --> 01:08.680
What we need now is time

01:09.120 --> 01:10.440
Must, before Qingzhou Army's main force

01:10.440 --> 01:11.520
Catches up to us

01:11.640 --> 01:12.800
Take the capital in one strike

01:15.080 --> 01:17.240
Need someone to block Qingzhou Army for us

01:19.360 --> 01:20.720
Any news from Beiyu Pass?

01:21.720 --> 01:23.160
General Zu Yue said

01:23.480 --> 01:25.840
I don't care how the Sikong family stirs things up

01:26.440 --> 01:27.640
This Beiyu Pass

01:28.480 --> 01:29.960
Always needs someone to guard it

01:30.440 --> 01:31.680
I won't let my father's

01:31.800 --> 01:34.000
Lifetime of honor be erased

01:37.160 --> 01:38.640
You crossing Tianhe

01:38.840 --> 01:40.280
I can pretend not to see

01:41.000 --> 01:42.560
If the court questions

01:43.480 --> 01:45.160
I will return to the capital to ask for punishment

01:46.160 --> 01:47.760
This is already the best news

01:48.720 --> 01:49.760
If it really comes to it

01:50.280 --> 01:51.800
Leave me three hundred warriors

01:52.200 --> 01:53.440
I'll cover the rear

01:54.040 --> 01:54.960
Report

01:56.960 --> 01:58.320
A Wuzhao person seeks an audience outside camp

01:58.320 --> 02:00.320
Says he can solve Your Highness's current predicament

02:02.160 --> 02:03.280
A Wuzhao person
