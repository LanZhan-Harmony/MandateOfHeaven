00:00.240 --> 00:01.000
I suspect

00:01.360 --> 00:02.760
This is Prince Ning's trap

00:04.200 --> 00:04.880
This is a forged edict

00:05.400 --> 00:06.480
Your Highness need not obey

00:07.880 --> 00:08.960
First report illness to the court

00:09.520 --> 00:10.240
Say

00:10.600 --> 00:11.880
After I recover

00:12.480 --> 00:13.840
I will return to the capital to ask for punishment

00:25.400 --> 00:27.520
He didn't get sick earlier or later

00:28.200 --> 00:29.200
But

00:30.080 --> 00:31.240
At this time

00:40.760 --> 00:42.080
Have the Ministry of War issue another edict

00:42.880 --> 00:44.520
Using Prince of Jin's illness as reason

00:44.760 --> 00:45.600
Have Chen Ying

00:45.720 --> 00:47.000
Take over his military command

00:47.400 --> 00:48.520
Test his limits

00:49.000 --> 00:49.360
Yes

00:49.760 --> 00:50.480
I'll do it right away

01:05.240 --> 01:06.240
Prince of Jin

01:06.400 --> 01:07.880
I come by court order

01:08.240 --> 01:09.960
To take over Yiyang military affairs

01:14.960 --> 01:16.840
I heard Your Highness is unwell

01:17.240 --> 01:18.280
I specially brought from the army

01:18.280 --> 01:19.840
The best physician

01:20.240 --> 01:20.880
How about

01:21.000 --> 01:22.640
Let him examine Your Highness

01:23.120 --> 01:23.760
No need

01:24.480 --> 01:25.120
No need

01:26.400 --> 01:27.400
My body

01:28.120 --> 01:29.760
Has already improved

01:30.360 --> 01:31.080
Soon

01:31.120 --> 01:32.080
I can return to court

01:33.000 --> 01:33.760
That's great

01:34.240 --> 01:36.400
As long as it doesn't affect the military handover

01:36.600 --> 01:37.240
Chen Ying

01:37.880 --> 01:38.880
What do you mean?

01:39.480 --> 01:41.000
Trying to burn bridges?

01:41.120 --> 01:42.200
Xie Xuan

01:42.760 --> 01:44.480
Is it your place to speak here?

01:49.200 --> 01:50.520
If Your Highness has concerns

01:50.600 --> 01:52.360
Then write a letter to the court

01:52.760 --> 01:53.360
Then

01:53.760 --> 01:54.960
Whatever the court says

01:55.240 --> 01:56.640
I will do accordingly

01:57.240 --> 01:57.880
Your Highness

01:58.400 --> 01:59.520
Not difficult, right?
