00:03.200 --> 00:04.760
Early in the 20th year of Yuankang

00:05.000 --> 00:06.680
Zu Kun broke through Beiyu Pass

00:06.880 --> 00:07.400
Afterward

00:07.400 --> 00:09.160
With the Wuzhao at the Hanshui line

00:09.160 --> 00:10.320
In a long stalemate

00:11.320 --> 00:13.080
In June of the 23rd year of Yuankang

00:13.320 --> 00:15.800
Zu Kun again petitioned for the northern expedition

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
The emperor did not approve

00:17.000 --> 00:18.680
Ordered him to withdraw and return to court

00:18.680 --> 00:19.800
Rise, rise

00:20.200 --> 00:22.760
Yet the northern people knelt to keep the royal army

00:23.160 --> 00:25.160
Volunteer armies also responded

00:26.280 --> 00:27.200
That September

00:27.440 --> 00:28.760
Zu Kun captured Zhongzhou

00:28.800 --> 00:30.640
Causing great shock in the court

00:31.000 --> 00:32.200
Defeat would harm the state

00:32.680 --> 00:33.400
Your Majesty

00:33.680 --> 00:35.360
This war really cannot continue

00:36.000 --> 00:38.400
The court issued eight imperial edicts

00:38.400 --> 00:40.320
Ordering Zu Kun not to advance further

00:40.720 --> 00:42.600
While cutting off his supplies

00:42.640 --> 00:44.960
Secretly ordered Chen Ying and others to withdraw

00:46.000 --> 00:46.880
October

00:47.080 --> 00:47.720
Chen Ying

00:47.720 --> 00:49.000
Crossed south over Tianhe

00:49.080 --> 00:51.320
Occupied the ferry behind Zu Kun

00:52.600 --> 00:53.600
Zu Kun knew

00:53.600 --> 00:54.520
To press on

00:54.600 --> 00:56.600
To take Yong'an was hopeless

00:57.000 --> 00:58.720
Years of war's accumulated ills

00:58.960 --> 01:00.520
Coupled with inner frustration

01:00.920 --> 01:02.040
Illness struck like a mountain

01:02.120 --> 01:02.520
General

01:02.600 --> 01:03.200
Soon

01:04.040 --> 01:05.120
Soon passed away at

01:05.200 --> 01:06.280
Beiyu Pass

01:06.400 --> 01:06.760
General

01:33.400 --> 01:34.760
My father told me

01:35.680 --> 01:37.760
He lived in Yong'an as a youth

01:39.040 --> 01:41.040
Always thought Yong'an wasn't special

01:42.000 --> 01:44.400
Those scholars' Ba willow trees

01:45.120 --> 01:46.280
Yong'an flowers

01:46.920 --> 01:48.200
Were just ordinary

01:54.040 --> 01:55.120
All these years

01:56.120 --> 01:57.640
I never thought my father

01:57.640 --> 01:59.640
Cared much about that hometown

02:00.760 --> 02:01.840
Doing all this

02:03.200 --> 02:04.640
Was just for advancement

02:05.280 --> 02:06.200
For reputation

02:07.120 --> 02:08.840
For those tens of thousands of

02:08.840 --> 02:10.440
Hungry mouths under him

02:16.280 --> 02:17.160
But this time

02:17.720 --> 02:18.880
Taking Beiyu Pass

02:21.120 --> 02:22.160
I realized

02:23.400 --> 02:25.000
He actually cared so much

02:31.400 --> 02:32.680
He stood right here

02:33.680 --> 02:34.680
He told me

02:35.120 --> 02:36.400
Standing this high

02:37.600 --> 02:39.800
Why still can't see Yong'an?

02:41.840 --> 02:43.160
Raising my eyes, I see the sun

02:45.120 --> 02:46.440
But not Yong'an

02:51.280 --> 02:52.560
Maybe when people get old

02:52.840 --> 02:54.000
They always miss home

02:58.280 --> 03:00.720
Your Highness in the palace, honored and precious

03:01.120 --> 03:02.560
Servants like clouds

03:02.840 --> 03:04.240
Pushing for the northern expedition

03:04.520 --> 03:06.840
Do you truly care about these northern lives

03:07.160 --> 03:08.840
Or to win hearts

03:10.440 --> 03:12.360
To gain leverage in the succession?
