WEBVTT

00:00.160 --> 00:01.560
I am both a prince

00:02.800 --> 00:04.160
And a subject

00:05.160 --> 00:06.000
How could there be

00:06.000 --> 00:07.360
Reason to disobey orders?

00:08.560 --> 00:10.360
This is my military seal

00:11.320 --> 00:12.640
I give it to General Chen

00:13.880 --> 00:15.000
I hope General Chen

00:15.160 --> 00:16.440
Will fulfill his duties diligently

00:16.880 --> 00:18.880
Do not disappoint the soldiers

00:26.160 --> 00:27.680
Please rest assured, Your Highness

00:27.960 --> 00:28.560
I

00:28.800 --> 00:30.640
Will not disappoint Your Highness

00:58.200 --> 00:59.400
He's so obedient

00:59.600 --> 01:01.080
Just handed over military command like that

01:04.800 --> 01:05.920
In my heart

01:06.400 --> 01:07.480
I'm uneasy

01:08.160 --> 01:09.400
A dog that bites

01:09.640 --> 01:10.800
Never barks

01:12.120 --> 01:12.840
In the past

01:12.840 --> 01:13.960
When Prince of Jin was imprisoned

01:14.400 --> 01:15.640
I advised Your Highness

01:15.640 --> 01:17.240
To go all the way

01:17.640 --> 01:18.920
But Your Highness then

01:19.000 --> 01:20.440
Hesitated

01:20.920 --> 01:21.840
Chancellor Chen

01:22.640 --> 01:24.480
Don't tease me

01:27.160 --> 01:28.160
Give the order

01:34.160 --> 01:36.080
Immediately order Qingzhou Army to break camp

01:36.400 --> 01:37.400
Move toward the capital

01:38.200 --> 01:38.920
Also

01:39.400 --> 01:40.160
Send Chen Ying

01:40.400 --> 01:41.440
Another letter

01:42.160 --> 01:42.600
Yes

01:56.880 --> 01:58.080
This is just my personal letter

01:58.640 --> 01:59.600
Why was it opened?

02:00.080 --> 02:01.120
General Chen Ying ordered

02:01.360 --> 02:02.680
All correspondence in the army

02:02.880 --> 02:04.000
Must first be sent to him for review

02:04.000 --> 02:04.920
Chen Ying

02:05.640 --> 02:06.720
Think clearly

02:07.160 --> 02:08.400
Whose orders do you follow?

02:08.640 --> 02:09.880
I only follow military orders

02:10.720 --> 02:12.880
Who promoted you all this way?

02:14.160 --> 02:15.680
I really misjudged you

02:16.120 --> 02:16.600
Get out

02:46.200 --> 02:46.800
Your Highness

02:47.960 --> 02:49.080
Let's have a good drink tonight

02:49.640 --> 02:50.200
Sir

02:51.000 --> 02:51.880
The volunteer army families

02:51.960 --> 02:53.440
All depend on Yiyang's compensation to survive

02:53.640 --> 02:54.840
Really can't delay any longer

02:55.000 --> 02:56.160
Want to talk? Fine

02:56.680 --> 02:57.840
After you're cleaned up

03:20.080 --> 03:20.880
The heir

03:21.160 --> 03:21.920
The princess consort

03:22.160 --> 03:23.000
Are both in the capital

03:23.600 --> 03:25.320
I must consider them

03:25.640 --> 03:27.320
Right now, no matter what

03:27.600 --> 03:28.600
Cannot act rashly

03:30.640 --> 03:31.160
Who?

03:32.960 --> 03:33.560
Your Highness

03:33.560 --> 03:34.200
It's me

03:37.600 --> 03:38.240
Zhu Yuanzhi

03:38.880 --> 03:39.560
What are you doing?

03:41.960 --> 03:42.880
At this time

03:44.080 --> 03:45.160
You kill Chen Ying's men

03:45.960 --> 03:47.000
Isn't that making things worse?

03:49.440 --> 03:50.160
Your Highness

03:51.440 --> 03:52.400
Look who's here

04:01.920 --> 04:02.560
Your Highness

04:02.680 --> 04:03.400
This old minister

04:03.400 --> 04:04.840
Finally sees you

04:07.000 --> 04:07.680
Please rise quickly

04:10.160 --> 04:11.120
Huiji is a thousand li

04:11.200 --> 04:12.000
From Yiyang

04:12.400 --> 04:13.120
How did you come?

04:13.200 --> 04:14.840
Since Your Highness's victory

04:14.920 --> 04:16.920
The situation has been crystal clear

04:17.360 --> 04:18.080
So I

04:18.200 --> 04:20.160
Left Huiji Commandery early

04:20.440 --> 04:22.160
Secretly returned to the capital to plan

04:22.960 --> 04:23.640
Your Highness

04:23.960 --> 04:25.920
This is what I intercepted from the capital

04:26.000 --> 04:28.160
A secret letter from Chen Dao to Chen Ying

04:43.120 --> 04:43.880
This is critical

04:44.200 --> 04:45.160
Quickly summon Xie Xuan

04:45.640 --> 04:46.640
And Uncle Qiu together

04:53.120 --> 04:54.560
Zhu Yuanzhi, how dare you

04:55.120 --> 04:57.120
My sister and the heir are still in the capital

04:57.320 --> 04:58.640
Are you trying to harm them?

05:01.640 --> 05:02.200
Brother-in-law

05:02.560 --> 05:03.400
Don't be impulsive

05:06.080 --> 05:06.640
Father

05:07.360 --> 05:08.640
Say something

05:21.000 --> 05:21.640
Your Highness

05:22.080 --> 05:23.000
Though somewhat offensive

05:23.360 --> 05:25.600
I must speak some words

05:26.400 --> 05:27.640
If Your Highness hesitates further

05:27.960 --> 05:29.360
Then we'll be like fish on a chopping block

05:29.560 --> 05:30.800
At others' mercy

05:31.160 --> 05:32.400
Enough, Zhu Yuanzhi

05:33.320 --> 05:35.160
Do you know what you're saying?

05:39.560 --> 05:40.960
I know Your Highness's concerns

05:41.960 --> 05:43.880
But if Your Highness truly dies here

05:44.240 --> 05:45.120
Then the princess consort

05:45.400 --> 05:46.200
And the heir

05:46.480 --> 05:48.360
Can they have a good outcome?

05:58.920 --> 05:59.680
Your Highness

06:00.000 --> 06:02.080
Strike first to gain advantage
