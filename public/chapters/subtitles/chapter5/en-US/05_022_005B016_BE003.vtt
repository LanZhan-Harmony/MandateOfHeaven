00:02.640 --> 00:03.520
General Chen

00:04.000 --> 00:05.760
You come with a Ministry of War order

00:06.840 --> 00:08.600
To take my, Prince of Jin's, military command

00:09.240 --> 00:10.880
I'm afraid that's not enough authority

00:11.720 --> 00:12.480
How about

00:12.720 --> 00:13.600
General Chen

00:14.200 --> 00:15.960
Go get an imperial edict

00:16.360 --> 00:19.000
Your Highness is deliberately making this difficult

00:20.120 --> 00:21.360
See the guest out

00:38.320 --> 00:39.600
I said the second prince

00:39.720 --> 00:41.120
Definitely has treacherous intentions

00:41.640 --> 00:42.320
Look

00:44.360 --> 00:45.480
Leaving him outside

00:46.080 --> 00:47.440
Will cause trouble sooner or later

00:48.520 --> 00:50.600
When Prince of Jin was imprisoned before

00:51.120 --> 00:52.480
I advised Your Highness

00:52.480 --> 00:54.080
To go all the way

00:54.480 --> 00:55.720
But Your Highness then

00:55.840 --> 00:57.000
Hesitated

00:57.720 --> 00:59.440
Chancellor Chen, don't tease me

00:59.720 --> 01:00.240
Now

01:00.480 --> 01:01.720
We must prevent the second prince

01:01.720 --> 01:03.640
From raising troops and marching on the capital

01:08.600 --> 01:10.600
Order Qingzhou Army vanguard

01:10.880 --> 01:11.600
Forced march

01:11.840 --> 01:12.640
Abandon supplies

01:13.120 --> 01:14.520
I don't care how many die from exhaustion

01:15.080 --> 01:16.360
At the fastest speed

01:16.360 --> 01:17.480
Rush to all the passes

01:18.240 --> 01:18.720
Must

01:18.880 --> 01:20.240
Get there before Prince of Jin

01:20.600 --> 01:21.120
Yes
