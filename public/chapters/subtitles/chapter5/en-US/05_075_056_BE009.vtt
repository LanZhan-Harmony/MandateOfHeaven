00:05.520 --> 00:07.200
Your Highness said push him down

00:07.480 --> 00:08.920
Can't you all hear?

00:12.080 --> 00:12.720
Your Highness

00:13.000 --> 00:14.880
His Majesty has given such generous terms

00:15.040 --> 00:15.720
Shouldn't we

00:16.120 --> 00:17.320
Just retreat back?

00:17.520 --> 00:18.520
Yes, Your Highness

00:18.720 --> 00:19.560
What did you say?

00:19.880 --> 00:20.800
Rebellion

00:21.400 --> 00:22.640
Do you want to rebel?

00:25.000 --> 00:26.120
Good sirs

00:26.120 --> 00:27.440
Good sirs

00:27.520 --> 00:29.400
Prince of Jin has defied the edict

00:29.400 --> 00:30.320
This will ruin

00:30.320 --> 00:31.640
All your futures

00:32.120 --> 00:33.800
Quickly seize him

00:33.800 --> 00:34.720
Quickly seize him

00:34.920 --> 00:36.600
Return to the capital with me for reward

00:39.520 --> 00:41.640
Your Highness, we fought battles for you

00:41.640 --> 00:43.040
Many brothers have died

00:43.040 --> 00:44.360
For the nation's great cause

00:44.360 --> 00:46.000
We can't let you continue making mistakes

00:46.160 --> 00:47.000
Brothers

00:47.040 --> 00:48.200
Tie up Your Highness
