00:09.360 --> 00:10.640
What is this?

00:20.080 --> 00:20.960
Father

00:25.000 --> 00:25.880
Sheng'er

00:28.520 --> 00:29.320
Sheng'er

00:29.880 --> 00:30.720
Your Highness

00:31.360 --> 00:32.760
Prince Ning's people watch too closely

00:33.320 --> 00:34.680
I used all my resources

00:34.920 --> 00:36.680
To barely hide the prince

00:37.200 --> 00:38.200
This was also what the Princess Consort

00:38.920 --> 00:40.920
Entrusted to me as her last request

00:43.400 --> 00:44.560
Come to Father's side

00:47.000 --> 00:48.760
Protecting the prince, you have merit

00:49.800 --> 00:50.720
What do you want?

00:51.680 --> 00:53.040
The Chen family has gone astray

00:54.040 --> 00:54.960
Now Chen Dao

00:55.200 --> 00:56.600
Leads Qingzhou Army outside

00:57.000 --> 00:58.440
To avoid making a grave mistake

00:58.800 --> 01:00.440
Wan'er brings the Chen family

01:01.120 --> 01:02.760
To ask Your Highness for forgiveness

01:04.680 --> 01:06.040
Things have come to this

01:06.200 --> 01:07.840
How can I forgive you?

01:09.560 --> 01:10.400
Your Highness

01:11.400 --> 01:14.040
I am a veteran minister of three reigns

01:14.440 --> 01:17.040
Served Your Highness's grandfather

01:17.400 --> 01:19.440
Served Your Highness's father

01:19.800 --> 01:22.720
Now Your Highness has entered the capital

01:22.720 --> 01:25.440
If not emperor, then effectively emperor

01:25.840 --> 01:28.400
We guilty ministers naturally deserve death

01:28.680 --> 01:30.760
But if Your Highness eliminates dissent

01:30.840 --> 01:32.160
And slaughters widely

01:32.560 --> 01:33.200
Chen Dao

01:33.200 --> 01:34.560
Using this as reason

01:34.560 --> 01:36.120
Will rally the gentry to rebel

01:36.120 --> 01:37.200
Wouldn't that

01:37.320 --> 01:39.480
Destroy Xuan's foundation?

01:39.480 --> 01:40.640
I hope Your Highness

01:40.800 --> 01:42.760
Will consider the greater good

01:44.960 --> 01:47.160
Qingzhou Army is less than thirty li from the capital

01:47.680 --> 01:48.760
If the two armies fight

01:49.120 --> 01:50.320
Victory is uncertain

01:54.160 --> 01:54.880
Good

01:55.880 --> 01:57.200
I promise you

01:57.360 --> 01:59.560
Will not purge any of you

02:00.200 --> 02:01.200
From today onward

02:01.520 --> 02:02.200
Everyone

02:02.680 --> 02:03.760
Will be restored to office

02:04.840 --> 02:06.200
Do what you should do

02:08.480 --> 02:09.160
Your Highness

02:10.440 --> 02:12.880
Forgive this old minister for speaking boldly

02:13.120 --> 02:13.840
This concerns

02:13.840 --> 02:15.360
Hundreds of families

02:15.400 --> 02:16.760
Matters of life and death

02:16.800 --> 02:18.640
With just Your Highness's word

02:18.760 --> 02:20.120
I'm afraid it's not enough

02:20.200 --> 02:21.680
What else do you want?

02:22.080 --> 02:23.080
I think

02:23.160 --> 02:24.960
To turn war into peace

02:25.080 --> 02:26.560
The best way

02:26.640 --> 02:28.160
Is to become one family

02:28.760 --> 02:29.600
If Your Highness

02:29.760 --> 02:32.040
Can marry my Chen family's eldest daughter

02:32.120 --> 02:33.520
The two families will reconcile

02:33.560 --> 02:35.080
Then from now on

02:35.160 --> 02:36.560
My Chen family

02:36.720 --> 02:38.120
Will definitely follow Your Highness

02:38.360 --> 02:40.080
With unwavering loyalty

02:41.000 --> 02:43.960
Willing to follow Your Highness

02:43.960 --> 02:45.400
Even to death
