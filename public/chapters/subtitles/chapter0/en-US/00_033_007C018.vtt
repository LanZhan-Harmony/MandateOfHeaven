00:00.720 --> 00:01.600
To spare him temporarily

00:01.760 --> 00:03.720
Was because your son wanted to catch more traitors

00:07.000 --> 00:09.200
You have such thoughts

00:09.600 --> 00:10.440
Father, please investigate

00:10.720 --> 00:12.320
Yu Gong, as Chancellor of the Imperial Academy

00:12.640 --> 00:14.600
Meets many students each year

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
Who knows if among them

00:16.520 --> 00:18.000
There aren't accomplices he incited

00:18.480 --> 00:19.520
Catching traitors

00:19.760 --> 00:21.200
Must not leave roots

00:22.120 --> 00:23.000
Your son spared him first

00:23.520 --> 00:24.840
To observe secretly

00:25.120 --> 00:25.960
And root out accomplices

00:26.360 --> 00:26.840
Unfortunately

00:27.360 --> 00:28.600
Last night's action by the Imperial City Guard

00:28.880 --> 00:29.720
Alerted the snake

00:30.600 --> 00:32.600
Ruined your son's carefully laid plans

00:33.000 --> 00:33.960
All for naught

00:34.480 --> 00:37.440
The Imperial City Guard has always been commanded by your elder brother

00:37.520 --> 00:38.360
So you're saying

00:38.880 --> 00:40.960
Your elder brother ruined your plan?

00:41.480 --> 00:41.880
No

00:42.480 --> 00:43.120
This matter

00:43.240 --> 00:44.360
Surely has nothing to do with elder brother

00:45.240 --> 00:46.240
It must be his subordinates

00:46.440 --> 00:47.120
Acting on their own

00:47.760 --> 00:48.600
Elder brother perhaps

00:49.440 --> 00:50.960
Was just coerced by the Chen family

00:51.480 --> 00:52.240
Then you

00:52.360 --> 00:54.600
Aren't you also coerced by the Xie family?

00:55.720 --> 00:58.440
Eliminate all those present at the tavern

00:58.720 --> 01:00.120
Cut ties with Yu Gong

01:00.240 --> 01:02.000
Ensure this matter

01:02.240 --> 01:03.600
Does not touch you at all

01:04.640 --> 01:05.240
Your son dares not

01:05.360 --> 01:06.640
Your son only obeys Father
