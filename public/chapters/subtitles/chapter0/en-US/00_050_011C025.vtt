00:00.760 --> 00:01.920
Yu Gong slandered the sovereign and father

00:02.160 --> 00:03.080
Deserves death ten thousand times

00:03.440 --> 00:04.440
But Father is benevolent

00:04.880 --> 00:06.000
If you could spare his life

00:06.200 --> 00:06.760
And exile him

00:06.880 --> 00:07.680
To the frontier

00:07.880 --> 00:08.920
Would be a good thing

00:09.720 --> 00:10.360
First

00:10.600 --> 00:11.720
It can warn the world

00:12.080 --> 00:13.680
Not to despise the court's authority

00:13.880 --> 00:14.400
Second

00:14.600 --> 00:15.680
It can show all the people

00:15.680 --> 00:17.680
Father's generous treatment of loyal and righteous men

00:18.160 --> 00:18.840
As the saying goes

00:18.920 --> 00:19.920
If crow eggs are not destroyed

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Then phoenixes will gather

00:21.560 --> 00:22.680
If slander is not punished with death

00:22.840 --> 00:23.320
Then

00:23.320 --> 00:24.120
Good counsel will flow

00:25.000 --> 00:25.960
Second son

00:26.920 --> 00:27.920
The principles in these books

00:28.000 --> 00:29.760
Can't be applied to everything

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
I also want to be a wise ruler for the ages

00:35.840 --> 00:36.320
But

00:36.840 --> 00:39.840
Our family has only been stable in the south for a few years

00:40.160 --> 00:42.440
So many great families are watching us

00:43.200 --> 00:43.720
I

00:43.960 --> 00:44.840
Cannot make mistakes

00:46.920 --> 00:47.720
Killing him

00:48.120 --> 00:49.720
May not be the act of a wise ruler

00:50.160 --> 00:51.160
But if I don't kill him

00:51.440 --> 00:51.920
In the future

00:51.920 --> 00:53.640
Anyone will dare to recklessly discuss court affairs
