Chancellor Yu

00:01.640 --> 00:02.760
Indeed went too far while drunk

00:02.920 --> 00:03.640
His words were wild and rebellious

00:04.120 --> 00:05.200
Execution would not be excessive

00:07.280 --> 00:07.840
But Father

00:08.280 --> 00:09.440
You are a wise and sagacious ruler

00:09.920 --> 00:10.560
As the saying goes

00:10.800 --> 00:11.800
If crow eggs are not destroyed

00:11.880 --> 00:12.800
Then phoenixes will gather

00:13.320 --> 00:14.360
If slander is not punished with death

00:14.640 --> 00:15.560
Then good counsel will flow

00:15.920 --> 00:16.680
Your son thinks

00:17.080 --> 00:17.760
You think

00:18.840 --> 00:20.920
You think by building a platform and putting me on it

00:22.080 --> 00:23.800
I won't kill him?
