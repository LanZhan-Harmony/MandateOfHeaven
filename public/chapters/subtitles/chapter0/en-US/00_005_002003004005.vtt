WEBVTT

00:00.240 --> 00:00.840
Your Highness

00:01.280 --> 00:02.120
Be careful in all matters

00:06.120 --> 00:06.560
Don't worry

00:17.960 --> 00:18.880
Stop swaying

00:19.120 --> 00:20.240
It's distracting

00:21.960 --> 00:22.840
Or perhaps, Your Excellency

00:23.120 --> 00:24.240
Could pay someone to perform a ritual

00:24.400 --> 00:26.160
To make Yu Gong appear from the Imperial City Guard

00:26.560 --> 00:27.560
Enough, both of you

00:30.280 --> 00:31.440
Your Highness

00:40.840 --> 00:41.440
Your Highness

00:41.680 --> 00:42.400
Tell us

00:42.400 --> 00:43.640
About that day

00:46.400 --> 00:47.560
Yu Gong, Chancellor of the Imperial Academy

00:48.080 --> 00:48.880
Was like a teacher to me

00:49.400 --> 00:49.840
That day

00:49.840 --> 00:50.360
That day

00:50.840 --> 00:52.000
He introduced his disciples to me

00:52.560 --> 00:53.840
After several rounds of wine

00:53.840 --> 00:54.560
Your Highness

00:54.560 --> 00:55.400
He got carried away

00:56.080 --> 00:56.800
Composed a sentimental poem

00:56.800 --> 00:57.280
Never forget

00:57.440 --> 00:59.440
The resolve to recover our divine land

00:59.960 --> 01:00.400
Now

01:01.480 --> 01:02.440
His poem

01:02.520 --> 01:04.480
Has been framed by my elder brother and the Chen family

01:04.480 --> 01:05.600
As inciting rebellion

01:06.400 --> 01:07.240
This is a disaster

01:07.680 --> 01:09.440
What exactly did Yu Gong say?

01:10.120 --> 01:11.880
What he wrote doesn't matter

01:12.400 --> 01:12.960
Since

01:13.120 --> 01:14.440
Your Highness was present that day

01:14.920 --> 01:16.240
Prince of Ning and the Chen family

01:16.320 --> 01:19.440
Must be trying to drag Your Highness into this

01:20.040 --> 01:20.840
The urgent matter

01:21.240 --> 01:22.480
Is to eliminate all those

01:22.480 --> 01:24.920
Who were present at the tavern that day

01:25.040 --> 01:26.600
To cut ties with Yu Gong

01:26.680 --> 01:28.240
And ensure this matter

01:28.600 --> 01:30.000
Does not touch you at all

01:31.040 --> 01:32.800
Minister Xie speaks so casually

01:33.440 --> 01:34.480
How many must die?

01:36.600 --> 01:37.120
Your Highness

01:37.600 --> 01:38.680
Yu Gong has great prestige

01:38.920 --> 01:39.560
In the Imperial Academy

01:39.720 --> 01:40.800
And among the people

01:41.040 --> 01:43.000
He has also recommended many talents to Your Highness

01:43.480 --> 01:44.920
If Your Highness abandons him

01:45.160 --> 01:47.040
What will scholars think?

01:47.360 --> 01:47.920
Moreover

01:48.680 --> 01:50.000
If you don't protect your own

01:50.160 --> 01:50.800
In the future

01:51.480 --> 01:52.560
Which court official

01:53.800 --> 01:55.160
Would dare serve Your Highness

01:55.720 --> 01:56.600
With wholehearted loyalty?

01:56.800 --> 01:58.360
A benevolent ruler cannot stand in troubled times

01:58.360 --> 02:00.600
Your Highness aims to recover the northern lost lands

02:00.920 --> 02:03.280
If you hesitate for one subordinate

02:03.560 --> 02:05.280
And create a rift with His Majesty

02:05.280 --> 02:05.800
Then

02:06.160 --> 02:07.920
That would be a greater loss

02:08.360 --> 02:08.920
Of course

02:09.160 --> 02:10.040
How to decide

02:10.240 --> 02:12.560
Is up to Your Highness
