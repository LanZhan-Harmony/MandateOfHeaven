00:01.280 --> 00:01.960
A few days later

00:02.280 --> 00:03.880
The court's edict was issued

00:04.080 --> 00:05.360
At noon today

00:05.520 --> 00:06.880
Yu Gong will be executed

00:16.000 --> 00:17.280
The Wutu people

00:17.720 --> 00:19.160
Trample our Central Plains

00:19.400 --> 00:21.160
The old capital in the north has fallen

00:21.560 --> 00:22.840
How dare the sovereign and father

00:22.840 --> 00:24.200
Seek temporary peace in the south

00:24.800 --> 00:26.840
How can you be so blind?

00:27.000 --> 00:28.440
The nobles indulge in pleasure

00:28.720 --> 00:30.200
The eldest son is cowardly

00:30.560 --> 00:33.400
Not seeing the bones of our homeland piled like mountains

00:34.240 --> 00:36.280
Today my body goes

00:37.440 --> 00:39.280
I seek no reincarnation

00:39.720 --> 00:41.880
I will watch you from above

00:42.360 --> 00:43.720
I will become the wind

00:44.240 --> 00:45.360
Become the rain

00:45.560 --> 00:46.720
Become lightning

00:46.720 --> 00:48.160
Cut out his tongue

00:48.520 --> 00:50.240
For our northern campaign's armor

00:50.240 --> 00:51.080
To cleave a path

00:55.920 --> 00:57.000
The time has come

00:57.360 --> 00:58.000
Execute

01:00.480 --> 01:01.000
Your Highness

01:01.400 --> 01:01.960
Don't look
