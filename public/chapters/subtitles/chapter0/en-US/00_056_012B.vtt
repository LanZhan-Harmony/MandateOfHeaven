00:00.480 --> 00:01.040
Father

00:02.280 --> 00:03.800
Your son is putting himself in another's place

00:04.280 --> 00:05.560
Your son now lives outside the palace

00:06.080 --> 00:07.720
Often must go to the provinces to handle affairs

00:08.320 --> 00:09.800
Often cannot be at your side

00:10.080 --> 00:11.080
When you need me

00:11.840 --> 00:13.040
But fear disappointing you

00:13.760 --> 00:15.160
Dare not slacken in duties

00:15.880 --> 00:16.560
Now

00:17.080 --> 00:18.840
Yu Gong committed such treasonous acts

00:19.280 --> 00:20.120
If he returns home

00:21.040 --> 00:23.120
His father will surely rebuke him for being disloyal and unfilial

00:23.480 --> 00:25.320
Yu Gong, deeply educated in propriety and law

00:25.720 --> 00:27.000
This punishment

00:28.280 --> 00:30.280
Is far worse than execution

00:31.840 --> 00:32.320
Good

00:33.120 --> 00:34.120
Well said

00:34.400 --> 00:35.640
This Yu Gong is like

00:35.800 --> 00:36.760
Half a teacher to you

00:37.560 --> 00:38.280
Having been with you long

00:38.560 --> 00:39.400
You can't bear to part

00:39.800 --> 00:41.120
Is only human

00:42.080 --> 00:42.560
Enough

00:43.560 --> 00:45.080
I'll give you a chance

00:50.240 --> 00:51.760
Play a game of chess with me

00:52.360 --> 00:53.480
If you win

00:54.120 --> 00:55.120
I'll grant your request

00:55.920 --> 00:56.880
Thank you, Father
