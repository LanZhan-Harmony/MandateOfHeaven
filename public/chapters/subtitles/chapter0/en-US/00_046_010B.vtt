00:01.040 --> 00:02.600
Father is about to gain a loyal and righteous man

00:02.760 --> 00:05.760
The kind of loyal man who points at my nose and curses

00:08.120 --> 00:10.400
You really think your father has lived too long

00:10.800 --> 00:11.600
Your son is terrified

00:12.760 --> 00:13.320
Enough

00:15.840 --> 00:16.840
His sentimental poem

00:17.080 --> 00:17.840
I've read it

00:18.680 --> 00:19.680
A pedantic scholar

00:19.840 --> 00:21.040
As if only he has a mouth

00:21.320 --> 00:22.680
As if only he is a parent official

00:23.080 --> 00:24.160
Living on my salary

00:24.400 --> 00:25.560
Cursing heaven and earth

00:25.560 --> 00:26.640
Even dares to curse me

00:28.400 --> 00:30.760
Yet my son, in the middle of the night

00:30.760 --> 00:32.120
Still pleads for him

00:32.520 --> 00:33.040
Speak

00:33.600 --> 00:34.320
What do you think I

00:34.480 --> 00:35.840
Should do with him?
