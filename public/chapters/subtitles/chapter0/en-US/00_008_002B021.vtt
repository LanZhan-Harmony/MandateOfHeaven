00:02.280 --> 00:02.800
This matter

00:03.040 --> 00:04.480
Shall be handled as Commandant Chu suggests

00:04.680 --> 00:06.920
Since Your Highness has decided

00:07.000 --> 00:07.680
Then this minister

00:07.760 --> 00:09.800
Offers another strategy

00:10.080 --> 00:10.920
The Chen family

00:10.920 --> 00:13.120
Has framed Yu Gong using "propriety and law"

00:13.280 --> 00:14.080
Then we

00:14.240 --> 00:16.920
Shall use "loyalty and filial piety" to save him

00:17.480 --> 00:19.320
Your Highness should enter the palace immediately

00:19.520 --> 00:22.040
And see His Majesty before morning court

00:22.200 --> 00:24.600
To resolve this matter behind the scenes

00:24.760 --> 00:25.440
Your Highness

00:25.440 --> 00:27.760
Must remember "loyalty and filial piety"

00:28.320 --> 00:29.040
I understand

00:37.360 --> 00:38.000
Eunuch Wen

00:38.520 --> 00:39.520
Father is not in his chambers

00:42.720 --> 00:44.240
His Majesty is in the Elixir Chamber

00:44.240 --> 00:45.680
Working on new pills

00:49.480 --> 00:50.520
It's been all night

00:51.280 --> 00:52.440
Father is still practicing Daoism?

00:52.760 --> 00:54.840
This old servant does not know
