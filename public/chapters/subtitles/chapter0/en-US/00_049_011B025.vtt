00:01.160 --> 00:01.600
Should

00:01.800 --> 00:02.480
Severely punish this man

00:02.840 --> 00:03.720
Sentence him to death

00:03.960 --> 00:05.680
You're not pleading for his life anymore?

00:06.000 --> 00:07.800
Yu Gong serves as Chancellor of the Imperial Academy

00:08.560 --> 00:10.440
Court affairs are not within his purview

00:10.800 --> 00:11.240
Can be charged with

00:11.400 --> 00:12.480
The crime of recklessly discussing court affairs

00:12.840 --> 00:13.840
Sentence him to beheading

00:14.840 --> 00:15.680
Good

00:16.800 --> 00:17.480
But

00:19.120 --> 00:19.720
Our dynasty

00:20.120 --> 00:21.440
Has always ruled through filial piety

00:21.920 --> 00:23.080
Yu Gong is the only son

00:23.560 --> 00:24.960
His young son died early

00:25.160 --> 00:26.600
His father is now over seventy

00:27.120 --> 00:27.720
Your son thinks

00:28.120 --> 00:28.880
He could be allowed

00:28.880 --> 00:29.880
To return home and fulfill filial duty first

00:30.160 --> 00:31.360
After his father passes

00:31.960 --> 00:32.880
Then carry out the execution

00:33.160 --> 00:34.360
Thus both loyalty and filial piety are preserved

00:34.720 --> 00:36.160
All the people will be moved by

00:36.240 --> 00:37.400
Your Majesty's virtue

00:37.680 --> 00:39.880
What a perfect balance of loyalty and filial piety

00:40.200 --> 00:42.320
This man's attacks against your father

00:42.400 --> 00:44.400
You don't mention at all
