00:07.720 --> 00:08.680
Second brother

00:14.680 --> 00:15.760
How have you been?

00:17.400 --> 00:18.400
Greetings, elder brother

00:27.160 --> 00:28.120
Second brother

00:28.640 --> 00:29.920
When did it start

00:30.440 --> 00:32.600
That we have nothing to say to each other?

00:32.840 --> 00:33.480
Elder brother

00:36.440 --> 00:37.720
Yu Gong is my teacher and friend

00:38.760 --> 00:39.760
You are my elder brother

00:41.400 --> 00:43.560
Losing either would grieve me deeply

00:44.880 --> 00:45.600
I thought

00:46.080 --> 00:47.160
We are brothers

00:48.040 --> 00:49.320
Even if bones break, the sinews remain connected

00:49.880 --> 00:51.160
Shouldn't have come to this

00:52.680 --> 00:53.440
What does elder brother think?

00:56.720 --> 00:57.600
Xie Jian'an

00:58.080 --> 00:58.840
Chu Huan

01:00.040 --> 01:01.400
Are both talents of our time

01:02.640 --> 01:03.560
You have them

01:03.680 --> 01:04.720
Yet you still want that Yu Gong

01:04.720 --> 01:06.240
To continue buying hearts for you

01:07.480 --> 01:08.440
What do you want to do?

01:08.960 --> 01:09.680
Brother
