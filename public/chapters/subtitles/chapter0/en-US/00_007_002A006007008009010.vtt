00:02.520 --> 00:03.200
This matter

00:04.240 --> 00:05.880
Shall be handled as Minister Xie suggests

00:08.680 --> 00:09.680
Since Your Highness has decided

00:10.200 --> 00:10.680
This matter

00:10.880 --> 00:11.880
Leave it to me

00:12.120 --> 00:13.800
I'll select a few trusted men

00:14.560 --> 00:15.520
And handle it right away

00:19.520 --> 00:21.440
Your Highness must stay calm

00:21.680 --> 00:22.800
As for other matters

00:22.880 --> 00:23.560
This old minister

00:23.560 --> 00:25.080
Will arrange everything properly

00:47.760 --> 00:48.320
Make it clean

00:49.000 --> 00:49.360
Yes

00:54.680 --> 00:55.440
Have you heard?

00:56.120 --> 00:57.680
That Chancellor Yu Gong of the Imperial Academy

00:57.880 --> 00:59.960
Has been convicted of treason by the Imperial City Guard

01:00.440 --> 01:01.680
I heard they had accomplices

01:02.120 --> 01:03.200
But overnight yesterday

01:03.320 --> 01:04.520
They all suddenly vanished

01:05.000 --> 01:05.560
Yes

01:05.880 --> 01:07.000
No one knows where they went

01:11.520 --> 01:14.080
His Majesty is unwell today

01:14.200 --> 01:15.440
No morning court

01:15.680 --> 01:16.680
Gentlemen

01:16.760 --> 01:17.760
You may disperse

01:19.440 --> 01:20.880
Yes, understood

01:22.240 --> 01:22.880
Yes

01:22.960 --> 01:24.000
Your Highness, Prince of Jin

01:28.960 --> 01:29.680
Eunuch Wen

01:30.440 --> 01:31.760
His Majesty has an edict

01:32.120 --> 01:34.000
Summoning you for a private audience

01:34.880 --> 01:35.440
Then

01:35.520 --> 01:36.200
I trouble you, Eunuch

01:44.680 --> 01:45.320
Eunuch Wen

01:49.080 --> 01:50.240
Father is not resting in his chambers

01:50.560 --> 01:51.120
His Majesty

01:51.120 --> 01:53.240
Is in the Elixir Chamber, working on new pills

01:55.000 --> 01:56.120
Does the Eunuch know

01:56.240 --> 01:57.960
Why Father wishes to see me alone?

01:58.320 --> 02:00.320
This old servant does not know
