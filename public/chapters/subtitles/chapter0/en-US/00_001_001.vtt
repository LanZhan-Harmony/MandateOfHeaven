00:03.080 --> 00:05.600
After Xuan Kingdom's founding and prosperity

00:05.880 --> 00:06.880
Incompetent rulers appeared frequently

00:07.000 --> 00:08.160
Internal strife became rampant

00:08.720 --> 00:10.640
The northern Wunu seized the chance to invade south

00:10.800 --> 00:12.320
Captured Guanzhong

00:13.240 --> 00:14.080
Soon

00:14.320 --> 00:15.920
The capital Yong'an City fell

00:16.240 --> 00:18.200
Royal clansmen were taken captive

00:18.360 --> 00:20.880
Common people were slaughtered

00:21.440 --> 00:23.240
Fortunately, Tian He provided a natural barrier

00:23.440 --> 00:26.400
Barely preserving half the realm

00:26.960 --> 00:28.400
Prince of Langya Sikong Jing

00:28.400 --> 00:29.840
Originally a collateral branch of the royal family

00:30.240 --> 00:31.640
But was enthroned by Imperial Chancellor Chen Dao

00:31.920 --> 00:33.440
Together with prominent noble families

00:33.560 --> 00:35.240
To ascend the throne

00:35.480 --> 00:36.960
South of Tian He

00:37.120 --> 00:38.880
Inheriting the imperial mandate

00:39.600 --> 00:40.760
You are Sikong Yao

00:40.960 --> 00:42.880
The emperor's second son

00:43.120 --> 00:44.600
Enfeoffed as Prince of Jin

00:45.360 --> 00:47.560
In this chaotic era

00:47.840 --> 00:49.760
How will you choose?

00:49.960 --> 00:52.280
How will history unfold?

00:52.560 --> 00:53.280
Everything

00:53.600 --> 00:55.880
Will be shaped by you

01:05.480 --> 01:06.480
What's the matter?

01:06.760 --> 01:08.120
Must you go out so late?

01:09.320 --> 01:09.920
Don't worry

01:10.200 --> 01:11.120
Just some poet friends

01:11.760 --> 01:12.760
Got drunk and caused some trouble

01:13.200 --> 01:13.960
I'll go handle it

01:32.160 --> 01:33.440
When a prince goes out on business

01:33.520 --> 01:34.640
You can't be too shabby

01:34.880 --> 01:35.600
Take this

01:39.800 --> 01:40.800
This Kunshan jade

01:41.000 --> 01:41.800
Could cover our household's

01:41.800 --> 01:43.080
Expenses for several months

01:44.040 --> 01:45.120
Unless it's someone truly important

01:45.560 --> 01:46.920
Don't give it away casually
