00:00.680 --> 00:02.520
Father is about to win the hearts of all

00:02.720 --> 00:03.880
Yu Gong, Chancellor of the Imperial Academy

00:04.080 --> 00:04.880
Has always been upright

00:05.080 --> 00:05.600
Only because

00:05.680 --> 00:06.600
He misspoke while drunk

00:07.280 --> 00:08.200
Now he's been framed

00:08.600 --> 00:09.680
If Father shows mercy to him

00:09.960 --> 00:11.080
You will surely win the people's hearts

00:11.680 --> 00:12.680
You mean

00:12.920 --> 00:13.720
If I don't save this man

00:14.160 --> 00:14.600
I

00:14.720 --> 00:16.800
Won't have the people's hearts?

00:17.640 --> 00:18.360
Your son misspoke

00:18.680 --> 00:19.200
Father

00:19.520 --> 00:21.080
Surely already has the hearts of all

00:24.840 --> 00:25.520
I see

00:26.160 --> 00:27.200
You and those

00:27.360 --> 00:29.640
Who claim to be pure and noble are too close

00:30.320 --> 00:31.640
The sages' books are good

00:32.160 --> 00:34.320
Reading them makes one want to be a pure remonstrating minister

00:34.640 --> 00:35.840
All think one mouth

00:36.040 --> 00:38.360
Can serve all the people

00:40.440 --> 00:41.520
One pedantic scholar

00:41.640 --> 00:43.440
Keeps you up all night

00:43.560 --> 00:44.800
And won't let me sleep either

00:47.200 --> 00:47.920
Second son

00:48.880 --> 00:49.400
Tell me

00:49.720 --> 00:51.800
If you sat in my position

00:51.880 --> 00:53.840
And Yu Gong cursed you today

00:53.920 --> 00:55.160
What would you do?
