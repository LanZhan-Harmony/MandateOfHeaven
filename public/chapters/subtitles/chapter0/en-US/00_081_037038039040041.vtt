00:03.080 --> 00:04.200
Second son

00:05.240 --> 00:06.760
You still haven't grown up

00:07.040 --> 00:09.360
The matter of Yu Gong was the Chen family's doing

00:09.680 --> 00:11.040
Just like the Xie family supporting you

00:11.280 --> 00:13.360
Also secretly tripped me up in Qing Province

00:14.520 --> 00:16.840
Not only delaying the canal's progress

00:16.920 --> 00:18.280
But also stirring up public resentment

00:18.440 --> 00:20.200
Angering His Majesty

00:20.200 --> 00:20.760
To this day

00:21.000 --> 00:23.480
Prince of Ning remains confined in the palace

00:26.880 --> 00:28.200
Looking at you

00:28.640 --> 00:30.240
You didn't know about this, did you?

00:32.840 --> 00:33.520
Second brother

00:34.440 --> 00:35.880
Even if you don't want to compete

00:36.240 --> 00:38.160
Those behind you will compete for you

00:38.160 --> 00:39.080
Make you compete

00:39.880 --> 00:41.640
Which prince of which dynasty

00:41.640 --> 00:42.920
Is not swept along?

00:43.760 --> 00:44.520
We

00:45.040 --> 00:46.880
Are the spearheads of those noble families

00:47.240 --> 00:48.360
To compete or not

00:49.280 --> 00:50.680
Is not up to us

00:51.400 --> 00:52.480
This matter

00:53.080 --> 00:55.240
From the day our father sat on the throne

00:55.520 --> 00:57.000
It began

01:01.000 --> 01:02.160
How old was your brother

01:02.240 --> 01:03.440
When you took him fishing in the river

01:03.680 --> 01:04.320
That fish

01:05.080 --> 01:06.160
Didn't you eat it too?

01:06.640 --> 01:07.640
Always protecting him like this

01:07.840 --> 01:08.880
Will lead to trouble

01:09.240 --> 01:09.800
It won't

01:10.440 --> 01:11.240
I'm the eldest

01:11.440 --> 01:12.760
I'll protect him all my life

01:15.320 --> 01:16.360
Where did the duck come from?

01:16.960 --> 01:17.920
I hunted it myself

01:18.400 --> 01:19.400
A hundred paces through a poplar

01:19.760 --> 01:21.400
This is called a hundred paces through a duck

01:22.400 --> 01:23.160
Here, try it

01:23.920 --> 01:24.520
Brother

01:25.080 --> 01:25.760
Blood

01:26.200 --> 01:26.920
Your blood

01:28.040 --> 01:28.840
You need to call the medic

01:28.920 --> 01:29.760
You can't go on like this

01:29.880 --> 01:30.360
It's fine

01:30.720 --> 01:31.240
Don't worry

01:31.680 --> 01:32.720
Let's talk on the boat

01:33.760 --> 01:34.800
Protect Prince of Jin

01:35.040 --> 01:36.360
Follow me and fight our way out

01:41.960 --> 01:42.680
Elder brother

01:44.560 --> 01:45.320
You've changed

01:46.680 --> 01:47.680
I've changed

01:52.840 --> 01:54.000
No, no, no

01:54.200 --> 01:56.040
The times have changed
