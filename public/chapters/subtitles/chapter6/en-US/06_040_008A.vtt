00:00.480 --> 00:01.160
Then

00:01.960 --> 00:03.000
I'll speak directly

00:04.720 --> 00:07.000
I hope you'll go to Qingzhou to organize reforms

00:07.440 --> 00:08.840
Change the original land tax system

00:08.840 --> 00:10.240
From taxing by headcount

00:10.280 --> 00:11.720
To taxing by land

00:12.000 --> 00:12.800
In this way

00:12.800 --> 00:14.200
Those with more land pay more tax

00:14.440 --> 00:16.240
Those with less land pay less tax

00:16.560 --> 00:17.480
Qingzhou

00:18.760 --> 00:19.560
That is

00:19.760 --> 00:21.480
Lady Chen's hometown

00:23.240 --> 00:25.080
Precisely because it's her family's place

00:25.320 --> 00:27.480
That's why we should use Qingzhou as a pilot

00:27.560 --> 00:29.240
To set an example for the whole country

00:33.320 --> 00:34.040
Look

00:34.760 --> 00:35.720
What Sheng'er wrote

00:39.520 --> 00:41.400
Although there are still many areas needing improvement

00:41.560 --> 00:43.400
I think you can help him perfect it

00:44.920 --> 00:45.920
You're his uncle

00:46.280 --> 00:47.240
This matter

00:47.600 --> 00:49.080
I only trust you

00:49.920 --> 00:50.480
I

00:52.200 --> 00:52.840
Understand

00:54.560 --> 00:55.240
I

00:56.000 --> 00:56.800
Accept the order
