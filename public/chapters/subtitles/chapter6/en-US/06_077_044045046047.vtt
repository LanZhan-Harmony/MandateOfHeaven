00:02.280 --> 00:03.080
Your Majesty

00:03.360 --> 00:04.760
This is news from Qing Province

00:05.040 --> 00:06.920
Xie Xuan is implementing reforms there

00:06.960 --> 00:07.760
It has sparked a popular uprising

00:08.320 --> 00:08.960
The gentry

00:09.280 --> 00:10.760
Nearly turned the provincial capital upside down

00:16.560 --> 00:17.360
This infuriates me

00:18.080 --> 00:19.440
Back when Yiyang was besieged

00:19.840 --> 00:21.960
Our volunteer army risked life and death for Your Majesty

00:22.360 --> 00:24.360
Only a few old brothers survived

00:24.680 --> 00:25.360
I don't believe

00:25.480 --> 00:26.840
Your Majesty would abandon us

00:26.960 --> 00:27.360
Right

00:27.640 --> 00:28.160
Let's go

00:28.360 --> 00:29.600
Come with me to the capital to see His Majesty

00:29.840 --> 00:30.840
To the capital to see His Majesty

00:31.080 --> 00:32.200
To the capital to see His Majesty

00:38.400 --> 00:39.400
Unfilial son

00:40.160 --> 00:40.560
You

00:41.080 --> 00:42.480
Kneel down

00:45.480 --> 00:47.760
The sages' books are for reading

00:47.960 --> 00:50.400
Not for you to actually use

00:52.600 --> 00:55.280
His Majesty sent you to reform in the Chen family's stronghold

00:56.440 --> 00:59.640
Can't you see the pattern?

01:06.360 --> 01:07.680
To achieve great things

01:08.320 --> 01:09.960
There must be sacrifices

01:10.160 --> 01:11.640
To achieve great things

01:12.240 --> 01:13.560
There must be sacrifices

01:13.880 --> 01:15.400
It's unavoidable

01:16.400 --> 01:17.640
This is what

01:19.560 --> 01:21.200
Father taught me

01:23.320 --> 01:24.120
Your Majesty

01:24.440 --> 01:25.840
Chancellor Xie requests an audience

01:33.920 --> 01:34.560
Summon him

01:39.120 --> 01:39.840
Your Majesty

01:39.920 --> 01:41.760
The reforms cannot continue

01:41.760 --> 01:44.280
In Qing Province, nobles are intertwined with nobles

01:44.280 --> 01:45.720
Personal connections are layered

01:45.840 --> 01:47.080
If we continue reforming

01:47.280 --> 01:48.640
It's no longer something Xie Xuan

01:48.640 --> 01:51.280
Can handle

01:52.600 --> 01:55.080
Your servant begs Your Majesty to revoke the order

01:55.640 --> 01:59.320
Don't let Xie Xuan wade into this muddy water anymore

02:00.800 --> 02:03.240
Your servant has already lost a daughter

02:03.280 --> 02:06.240
Now only this one son remains

02:09.120 --> 02:09.880
Your Majesty

02:10.400 --> 02:14.360
Your Majesty, this old servant begs you, Your Majesty
