WEBVTT

00:00.520 --> 00:02.040
Back in the 10th year of Yuankang

00:02.120 --> 00:03.560
Our Xuan Kingdom's annual tax revenue

00:03.560 --> 00:05.200
Could reach over 18 million taels

00:06.560 --> 00:08.280
Why, when it reached Chancellor Xie

00:08.320 --> 00:10.240
Only 10.5 million taels remained?

00:10.560 --> 00:11.120
I

00:11.720 --> 00:13.280
Deserve death ten thousand times

00:17.040 --> 00:17.720
Your Majesty

00:17.960 --> 00:20.720
After several major battles in recent years

00:20.960 --> 00:23.560
Border trade with the Wuzhao was closed

00:23.560 --> 00:24.040
This

00:24.560 --> 00:26.560
Lost a large amount of revenue

00:27.040 --> 00:28.000
Your Majesty

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Implemented benevolent policies for the people

00:30.040 --> 00:32.320
Taxes everywhere were reduced, this

00:32.520 --> 00:34.640
Lost another large amount of revenue

00:35.560 --> 00:36.480
Your Majesty

00:37.080 --> 00:39.200
For Your Majesty's grand ambitions

00:39.240 --> 00:40.840
I will definitely find a way

00:41.000 --> 00:42.640
To quickly fill the treasury

00:42.880 --> 00:44.040
Physicians often say

00:44.040 --> 00:45.480
Severe illness requires strong medicine

00:45.480 --> 00:47.000
If there is any blame

00:47.200 --> 00:48.040
I will bear it

00:50.480 --> 00:51.360
Alright, alright

00:52.600 --> 00:53.400
I'm tired

00:54.080 --> 00:55.040
Think it over yourself

00:55.760 --> 00:56.600
All withdraw

00:57.040 --> 00:57.560
Yes

00:57.640 --> 00:59.120
I take my leave

01:07.240 --> 01:08.040
Come out

01:19.040 --> 01:19.760
Your Majesty

01:20.400 --> 01:22.800
I have verified everything

01:23.480 --> 01:24.800
The Xie family colluded with factions

01:25.360 --> 01:27.480
Layered exploitation of state taxes

01:28.040 --> 01:29.240
Originally two hundred taels of silver

01:29.400 --> 01:30.320
When it reached the court

01:30.720 --> 01:32.000
Only one hundred taels remained

01:32.960 --> 01:33.360
Also

01:33.800 --> 01:36.200
This year's Ministry of Revenue's list of official appointments

01:36.360 --> 01:38.280
More than half are Chen clan members

01:38.600 --> 01:39.400
The remaining half

01:39.760 --> 01:41.400
Most are also from the Xie and Zu families

01:41.720 --> 01:43.320
And their retainers and students

01:45.840 --> 01:46.800
As for

01:47.120 --> 01:48.320
The mad horse at the hunting ground

01:48.320 --> 01:50.640
That nearly collided with Your Majesty

01:50.960 --> 01:51.600
I

01:52.040 --> 01:54.080
Also heard some rumors

01:54.480 --> 01:54.960
Saying

01:55.320 --> 01:56.640
According to informants

01:57.200 --> 01:58.560
Because the Wuzhao are skilled with horses

01:59.040 --> 02:01.240
So in General Zu Yue's army

02:01.240 --> 02:02.480
They once developed a kind of

02:02.560 --> 02:04.760
Fierce drug that can make warhorses go mad

02:06.040 --> 02:06.880
Your Majesty

02:07.040 --> 02:08.200
Be careful

02:10.240 --> 02:12.840
And that mad horse that nearly collided with Your Majesty

02:13.040 --> 02:14.320
Was exactly given this drug

02:14.600 --> 02:16.040
The informant also said

02:16.400 --> 02:18.320
That drugged horse

02:21.520 --> 02:22.760
Why are you beating around the bush?

02:23.080 --> 02:24.400
I told you to speak, so speak

02:26.120 --> 02:27.000
That horse

02:27.360 --> 02:29.320
Was originally meant for the second prince

02:29.640 --> 02:30.360
Only

02:30.560 --> 02:32.240
The crown prince happened to ride it

02:36.720 --> 02:37.320
Enough

02:38.040 --> 02:39.560
Keep this matter buried in your stomach

02:40.000 --> 02:40.640
Understand?

02:41.800 --> 02:42.640
I understand

02:44.760 --> 02:45.480
Dismissed

02:57.280 --> 02:59.320
Chancellor Xie Jian'an

03:01.200 --> 03:03.080
Really got his money's worth

03:04.360 --> 03:05.280
Now

03:05.520 --> 03:06.760
We are not yet firmly established

03:06.800 --> 03:08.760
It's not yet time to move against them

03:10.240 --> 03:12.880
I have a word of warning for you

03:13.600 --> 03:16.000
Don't trust and rely too much on your subordinates

03:16.640 --> 03:18.560
Don't become their puppet

03:18.560 --> 03:20.640
You and your elder brother are family

03:25.400 --> 03:27.560
Father really had it difficult back then

03:27.800 --> 03:29.800
You lamented the great families growing powerful

03:29.960 --> 03:31.800
Restraining you everywhere

03:32.280 --> 03:33.200
But now

03:33.320 --> 03:35.120
The state still has many matters

03:35.200 --> 03:37.000
That require these people to handle

03:37.240 --> 03:39.400
Yet you cannot move against them

03:40.960 --> 03:42.400
Now the Chen and Xie families

03:42.480 --> 03:43.760
Frequently intermarry

03:44.320 --> 03:45.560
If they unite

03:45.600 --> 03:47.360
Will only become harder to deal with

03:48.480 --> 03:49.840
Reform is necessary

03:50.280 --> 03:51.240
But reform

03:51.800 --> 03:53.480
How should it be done?

04:13.760 --> 04:15.400
Treatise on Land

04:23.800 --> 04:26.000
Sheng'er's political ideas are very good

04:26.200 --> 04:27.720
Can indeed solve Xuan's current

04:27.720 --> 04:28.880
Contradictions and problems

04:29.560 --> 04:31.600
But some ideas are still too one-sided

04:32.640 --> 04:34.240
To successfully implement it

04:35.320 --> 04:37.200
We need someone with a high enough position

04:37.560 --> 04:38.000
And

04:38.120 --> 04:39.880
Who can put the state's interests first

04:40.320 --> 04:41.720
And is absolutely trustworthy

04:44.520 --> 04:45.640
Marquis of Yongning

04:46.280 --> 04:47.320
Xie Xuan
