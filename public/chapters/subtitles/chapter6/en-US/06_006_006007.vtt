00:02.920 --> 00:03.600
Your Majesty

00:03.760 --> 00:04.920
General Zu has arrived

00:06.880 --> 00:07.480
Alright

00:07.960 --> 00:09.320
That's enough discussion for today

00:09.960 --> 00:11.480
Go practice horsemanship

00:11.920 --> 00:12.920
Yes, Father

00:15.360 --> 00:15.960
Yu'er

00:17.440 --> 00:20.120
How about having Fan Zhong take you to catch rabbits?

00:20.480 --> 00:21.240
Great

00:24.120 --> 00:24.680
Father

00:25.360 --> 00:26.680
Before meeting the general

00:26.680 --> 00:28.680
Better wipe your hands clean first

00:30.240 --> 00:31.120
Good

00:41.320 --> 00:41.880
Back then

00:42.320 --> 00:44.200
Your Majesty gave Shilang several hundred sets of armor

00:44.440 --> 00:45.200
Never expected

00:45.760 --> 00:47.240
He could use just that

00:47.240 --> 00:48.560
To kill Ayidai and seize power

00:48.680 --> 00:49.320
Now

00:49.680 --> 00:51.120
Shilang has swept the north

00:51.120 --> 00:51.920
Established the Wei state

00:52.680 --> 00:54.440
Wuzhao tribes have also submitted

00:55.320 --> 00:56.200
Scouts report

00:56.800 --> 00:58.120
They are training troops

00:58.360 --> 00:59.680
Perhaps before long

01:00.120 --> 01:01.680
They will attack us from the south

01:03.640 --> 01:04.200
Your Majesty

01:04.800 --> 01:06.000
We must prepare early

01:08.800 --> 01:10.760
Shilang is waiting for an opportunity

01:12.320 --> 01:13.800
I am also waiting

01:18.320 --> 01:18.920
By the way

01:19.560 --> 01:20.440
Your daughter

01:20.800 --> 01:22.120
Since she's betrothed to Sheng'er

01:22.240 --> 01:23.480
Let her come to the palace to visit

01:23.800 --> 01:25.320
Nandu's feng shui nurtures people

01:26.440 --> 01:27.240
Of course

01:27.880 --> 01:29.800
Move aside, quickly move aside

01:32.200 --> 01:32.800
Your Majesty

01:33.320 --> 01:34.320
Be careful

01:34.880 --> 01:35.640
Your Majesty, be careful

01:38.240 --> 01:39.080
The startled horse is out of control

01:39.200 --> 01:39.920
Your son deserves death

01:40.240 --> 01:40.680
Your son deserves death

01:40.680 --> 01:41.120
Where is the stable master?

01:41.560 --> 01:42.440
Where is the stable master?

01:43.120 --> 01:44.680
How was this mad horse selected?

01:47.120 --> 01:47.760
Your Majesty

01:48.200 --> 01:49.080
The startled horse is out of control

01:49.640 --> 01:50.760
Is definitely not the crown prince's fault

01:51.120 --> 01:52.160
I request the stable master be executed immediately
