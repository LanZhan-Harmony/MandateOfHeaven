00:05.800 --> 00:08.120
I will draft an edict to depose the Crown Prince

00:08.480 --> 00:09.840
To satisfy them

00:11.480 --> 00:12.760
All dismissed for now

00:14.280 --> 00:15.520
Let me have some peace

01:08.720 --> 01:10.640
Have Marquis of Yongning guard the empress's tomb

01:10.720 --> 01:11.600
Your Majesty

01:12.000 --> 01:14.080
Your servant Xie Xuan requests an audience

01:41.680 --> 01:43.400
In the future, Great Xuan will be restored

01:43.920 --> 01:45.320
Lost territories will be recovered

01:46.440 --> 01:47.360
In the history books

01:48.360 --> 01:49.360
Not only brother-in-law

01:49.880 --> 01:51.120
Not only sister

01:52.520 --> 01:54.720
There will also be a record of me, Xie Xuan

02:00.800 --> 02:01.600
Fan Zhong

02:02.200 --> 02:03.600
Bring me a jug of wine

02:22.120 --> 02:23.880
The 21st year of Longwu

02:24.480 --> 02:26.840
Xie Xuan was executed by Emperor Sikong Yao

02:26.840 --> 02:28.680
On charges of persecuting loyal officials

02:28.800 --> 02:30.520
In the capital

02:31.160 --> 02:31.800
At the same time

02:31.920 --> 02:33.200
The emperor also ordered

02:33.320 --> 02:34.240
The Crown Prince

02:34.600 --> 02:36.320
To be confined to the palace

02:40.120 --> 02:41.080
Time is up

02:41.440 --> 02:42.200
Execute

02:43.760 --> 02:44.760
Brother-in-law

02:47.240 --> 02:48.880
Speaking of defeat before the battle

02:49.600 --> 02:51.960
Staying in the capital has made your bones soft

02:55.520 --> 02:56.480
Since we must fight to the death

02:56.720 --> 02:58.280
I won't be such a coward

03:01.760 --> 03:02.400
Brother-in-law

03:02.840 --> 03:04.600
I request to lead the cavalry out of the city

03:05.320 --> 03:06.760
You, as a Xuan person

03:09.880 --> 03:11.640

03:12.400 --> 03:13.080
Kill him

03:16.720 --> 03:17.480
One day

03:18.160 --> 03:19.160
Give me one more day

03:19.520 --> 03:20.840
I will personally lead the battle

03:21.920 --> 03:22.640
Under my command

03:23.360 --> 03:24.480
There are also over a hundred men
