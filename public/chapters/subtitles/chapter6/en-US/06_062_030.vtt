00:05.160 --> 00:05.960
Your Majesty

00:06.560 --> 00:08.160
The Ministry of War has complained several times

00:08.160 --> 00:08.640
Saying

00:08.760 --> 00:09.720
They can no longer command

00:09.720 --> 00:11.280
Zhu Yuanzhi's Beishuo Army

00:12.160 --> 00:13.120
This army

00:13.320 --> 00:15.120
Was originally formed from refugees

00:19.800 --> 00:20.520
Most

00:20.800 --> 00:22.160
Only recognize their commander

00:22.240 --> 00:23.280
Only care about relationships

00:23.920 --> 00:25.680
Since General Zhu took command

00:25.960 --> 00:28.240
His orders in the Beishuo Army

00:28.440 --> 00:30.040
Are more effective than imperial orders

00:30.240 --> 00:31.120
I believe

00:31.320 --> 00:32.120
Your Majesty

00:32.160 --> 00:35.000
Should curtail Zhu Yuanzhi's power as soon as possible

00:35.160 --> 00:36.960
Since Chancellor Xie has come together

00:37.840 --> 00:40.120
He must already have an idea in mind

00:41.800 --> 00:42.720
In my view

00:42.920 --> 00:45.200
Your Majesty can summon General Zhu to the capital

00:45.360 --> 00:47.360
Then give him a nominal position

00:47.360 --> 00:49.640
Transfer Chu Meng to command the Beishuo Army

00:51.800 --> 00:53.960
Your Majesty, be careful

00:56.040 --> 00:58.160
First, Chu Meng is Chu Huan's son

00:58.160 --> 00:59.360
Descendant of loyal martyrs

00:59.600 --> 01:01.280
This status is sufficient

01:01.440 --> 01:03.520
Second, Chu Meng is rigorous

01:03.560 --> 01:04.640
Humble and loyal

01:05.000 --> 01:07.840
Perfect for rectifying the Beishuo Army's atmosphere
