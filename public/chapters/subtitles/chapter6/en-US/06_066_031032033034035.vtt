00:00.400 --> 00:03.440
Please invite the Yan Dong envoy to the court

00:09.800 --> 00:10.920
Greetings, Your Majesty

00:12.200 --> 00:13.520
Envoy, please rise

00:17.400 --> 00:18.000
Your Majesty

00:18.760 --> 00:19.920
For decades

00:20.120 --> 00:21.400
Our Yan Dong court

00:21.560 --> 00:23.160
Has still held Xuan Kingdom's credentials

00:23.280 --> 00:25.160
And considers itself a vassal state of Xuan

00:25.760 --> 00:27.160
Now my father has sent me

00:27.520 --> 00:28.520
Hoping even more

00:28.680 --> 00:29.680
To be able to

00:30.000 --> 00:31.120
Restore our former friendship with Your Majesty

00:31.960 --> 00:34.080
We are willing to offer ten thousand fine horses

00:34.480 --> 00:35.880
To marry a princess

00:36.120 --> 00:37.000
As queen

00:37.800 --> 00:38.600
From then on

00:38.720 --> 00:39.520
With Great Xuan

00:39.640 --> 00:40.920
We will work together in harmony

00:41.160 --> 00:42.080
Sharing the same spirit

00:42.640 --> 00:43.480
And connected branches

00:47.240 --> 00:48.200
This proposal

00:49.280 --> 00:50.600
I will consider it

00:51.920 --> 00:53.760
The Yan Dong envoy has come from afar

00:54.120 --> 00:55.120
After a long journey

00:55.560 --> 00:56.200
Please

00:56.560 --> 00:58.400
Return early to rest

00:58.960 --> 01:00.120
Thank you, Your Majesty

01:05.440 --> 01:06.280
Excellent

01:06.320 --> 01:07.080
Yan Dong

01:07.160 --> 01:09.560
Is willing to help us attack Wuzhao

01:09.600 --> 01:11.040
But they want to marry a princess

01:11.160 --> 01:13.440
Isn't there only Princess Xunyang in the palace?

01:13.760 --> 01:14.320
Right

01:14.920 --> 01:16.320
Just marry Princess Xunyang off to them

01:16.600 --> 01:17.280
Alright

01:17.880 --> 01:19.160
Let's discuss the next matter

01:27.560 --> 01:28.240
Your Majesty

01:28.760 --> 01:30.600
Lady Liu is still kneeling outside

01:30.960 --> 01:32.000
We can't persuade her to leave

02:07.200 --> 02:08.160
Your Majesty

02:10.400 --> 02:12.720
When you were in Yiyang, you promised Grandfather

02:13.600 --> 02:14.800
To protect me

02:15.000 --> 02:16.720
In peace and happiness for life

02:17.600 --> 02:19.160
I want nothing

02:19.520 --> 02:21.400
I beg you, don't let Yu'er leave

02:33.520 --> 02:34.240
Rise first

02:51.680 --> 02:52.440
Your Majesty

02:53.520 --> 02:55.120
Don't let Yu'er leave

02:55.600 --> 02:56.960
I beg you

03:04.280 --> 03:05.280
Listen to me

03:06.400 --> 03:07.240
Return to the palace first

03:24.000 --> 03:24.640
Father

03:25.120 --> 03:26.880
Yan Dong has also been harassed by Wuzhao for years

03:26.960 --> 03:27.680
Your son believes

03:28.120 --> 03:29.680
If the two states can form a marriage alliance

03:30.080 --> 03:31.800
To watch over each other and together drive out Wuzhao

03:32.080 --> 03:33.320
Would be the best strategy

03:34.080 --> 03:34.880
Sikong Sheng

03:35.280 --> 03:36.440
You're a coward

03:36.640 --> 03:37.680
That's your sister

03:38.040 --> 03:39.680
How can you let her marry to a place like Yan Dong

03:40.040 --> 03:41.520
A remote and poor place to suffer

03:42.120 --> 03:43.120
With Yan Dong's assistance

03:43.480 --> 03:44.880
How many fewer of our people would die

03:46.280 --> 03:47.080
To let my sister marry far away

03:47.120 --> 03:48.520
How could I not be heartbroken

03:49.000 --> 03:49.920
But as members of the royal family

03:50.600 --> 03:52.320
Why not bear the responsibility for the people

03:54.120 --> 03:55.680
Do you think the people kneel to you

03:55.880 --> 03:56.400
Kneel to me

03:56.520 --> 03:57.600
Kneel to Princess Xunyang

04:00.680 --> 04:01.240
Father

04:01.560 --> 04:02.480
If the state and realm

04:02.640 --> 04:03.800
Must rely on Yu'er, a mere woman

04:03.800 --> 04:04.640
To bring stability and revival

04:05.080 --> 04:06.600
Then what use are all the men in court

04:07.280 --> 04:07.800
Father

04:08.480 --> 04:09.680
Your son is willing to be the vanguard

04:10.120 --> 04:11.000
On the day of the northern expedition

04:11.120 --> 04:12.120
To defeat Wuzhao

04:14.320 --> 04:15.640
Father's lifelong efforts

04:16.000 --> 04:17.160
Have all been for reviving Great Xuan

04:17.600 --> 04:18.960
You are the father of all under heaven

04:19.200 --> 04:20.480
Should not be limited to one family

04:20.480 --> 04:21.400
By personal affections

04:23.880 --> 04:24.680
All rise

04:25.200 --> 04:25.720
I

04:26.760 --> 04:27.720
Will make my own decision

04:48.080 --> 04:48.680
Your Majesty

04:49.680 --> 04:51.680
The Ministry of Rites just sent someone to ask again

04:52.280 --> 04:54.400
Only a few days left before the envoy returns

04:55.120 --> 04:56.680
We must have an answer

04:57.600 --> 04:58.560
Before

04:59.160 --> 05:00.880
I asked you to sound her out

05:01.120 --> 05:02.480
To ask Xunyang's thoughts

05:04.120 --> 05:05.520
The princess cares for Your Majesty

05:05.680 --> 05:06.640
This servant sees

05:07.080 --> 05:08.200
She is willing to go

05:10.440 --> 05:11.440
She said nothing else

05:12.280 --> 05:12.920
This

05:14.520 --> 05:15.560
To leave home thousands of miles away

05:15.560 --> 05:16.640
Sorrow is inevitable

05:17.120 --> 05:18.640
But Princess Xunyang is filial

05:19.080 --> 05:21.120
She would never go against Your Majesty's wishes
