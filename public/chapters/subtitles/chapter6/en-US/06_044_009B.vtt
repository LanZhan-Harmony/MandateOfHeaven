00:01.520 --> 00:02.400
Your sister

00:02.480 --> 00:03.600
She was a good wife

00:03.960 --> 00:04.720
Yes

00:05.360 --> 00:06.080
For you

00:07.240 --> 00:09.360
She did what a wife should do

00:19.240 --> 00:20.360
Your Majesty, rest assured

00:21.080 --> 00:21.840
I

00:21.880 --> 00:22.720
Like my sister

00:23.120 --> 00:23.880
For Your Majesty

00:24.160 --> 00:25.360
Will devote myself completely

00:25.560 --> 00:27.080
If Your Majesty has any orders

00:28.120 --> 00:29.400
Just speak directly

00:31.960 --> 00:32.560
Good

00:33.600 --> 00:34.760
Then I'll speak directly

00:45.160 --> 00:46.480
This is what Sheng'er wrote

00:52.200 --> 00:54.480
Although there are still many areas needing improvement

00:56.160 --> 00:57.160
But I think

00:57.400 --> 00:58.560
You can help him

00:59.080 --> 01:00.040
You're his uncle

01:00.600 --> 01:01.560
This matter

01:01.960 --> 01:03.080
I only trust you

01:06.520 --> 01:07.200
I hope

01:08.040 --> 01:09.240
You'll go to Qingzhou

01:09.400 --> 01:10.440
To organize reforms

01:11.080 --> 01:12.560
Change the original land tax system

01:12.840 --> 01:13.880
From taxing by headcount

01:14.480 --> 01:15.920
To taxing by land

01:16.400 --> 01:17.040
In this way

01:17.240 --> 01:18.120
Those with more land

01:18.360 --> 01:19.480
Will pay more tax

01:19.760 --> 01:20.880
Those with less land

01:21.000 --> 01:22.120
Can pay less tax

01:23.080 --> 01:24.040
If the results are good

01:24.400 --> 01:25.520
Then extend to the whole country

01:27.240 --> 01:28.120
Qingzhou

01:29.200 --> 01:30.840
Lady Chen's hometown

01:31.280 --> 01:32.080
What?

01:33.680 --> 01:34.400
It's fine

01:34.880 --> 01:35.920
Your Majesty, rest assured

01:36.280 --> 01:37.440
This matter

01:37.560 --> 01:38.200
I

01:38.640 --> 01:40.400
Will do my utmost

01:42.440 --> 01:43.280
Come, drink
