00:00.320 --> 00:01.560
Wait until Your Majesty

00:01.680 --> 00:03.280
Surrenders Xie Xuan, then he'll come

00:03.960 --> 00:04.560
By then

00:04.680 --> 00:06.080
No one can fault him

00:06.160 --> 00:07.080
Enough

00:09.480 --> 00:10.360
My general

00:11.680 --> 00:12.600
If I use him

00:13.680 --> 00:14.600
I trust him

00:17.320 --> 00:18.480
Order Zhu Yuanzhi

00:19.400 --> 00:20.240
To rescue the emperor

00:20.760 --> 00:21.480
Yes

00:24.040 --> 00:25.880
The 21st year of Longwu

00:26.200 --> 00:28.240
Zhu Yuanzhi led troops to rescue the emperor

00:28.600 --> 00:29.720
In less than half a month

00:29.720 --> 00:32.240
He pierced through the western aristocratic coalition

00:32.640 --> 00:35.520
Then launched a lightning strike on the southern commander's camp

00:35.520 --> 00:37.560
Personally beheaded the rebel general

00:37.960 --> 00:40.160
The eastern route scattered like birds and beasts upon hearing the news

00:40.360 --> 00:43.480
The great families submitted memorials begging for mercy

00:50.000 --> 00:51.120
Zhu Yuanzhi

00:51.520 --> 00:52.800
The rebels are now pacified

00:52.920 --> 00:54.160
Why aren't you wearing court robes?

00:54.240 --> 00:55.240
Wearing armor in court

00:55.960 --> 00:56.320
Right

00:56.320 --> 00:56.720
This is

01:01.680 --> 01:02.600
Well said

01:03.720 --> 01:04.920
Otherwise, Minister Wang

01:05.320 --> 01:07.600
How about going to the front to fight for me?

01:07.800 --> 01:09.240
In the court

01:09.400 --> 01:11.760
General Zhu, please be careful with your words

01:15.520 --> 01:16.560
Don't think

01:16.720 --> 01:17.720
I don't know how you

01:17.720 --> 01:19.680
Talk about me behind my back

01:20.200 --> 01:22.640
If not for concern for Your Majesty's safety

01:23.120 --> 01:24.760
Would I have rushed through the night

01:24.960 --> 01:27.720
To save you gossiping women?

01:28.200 --> 01:28.760
You

01:31.040 --> 01:32.600
And some of you

01:33.240 --> 01:35.680
I don't care how you fight behind the scenes

01:36.200 --> 01:38.360
Whoever dares involve Your Majesty

01:38.960 --> 01:41.240
Better think carefully

01:45.280 --> 01:46.560
Who has such great resentment?

01:46.560 --> 01:47.560
Kowtow to Your Majesty

01:47.680 --> 01:50.080
We pay respects to Your Majesty

01:50.840 --> 01:51.680
You've worked hard

01:52.040 --> 01:52.800
General Zhu

01:53.200 --> 01:54.480
Your Majesty is well

01:54.600 --> 01:55.880
I am not tired

01:58.640 --> 01:59.480
Read

02:04.040 --> 02:06.120
General Zhu Yuanzhi of Zhenbei

02:06.240 --> 02:07.560
Loyalty and courage bestowed by heaven

02:07.560 --> 02:08.800
Merits illustrious

02:08.920 --> 02:10.200
Rescued the emperor and quelled rebellion

02:10.200 --> 02:11.400
Merit surpassing all officials

02:11.920 --> 02:13.960
Now specially promoted to Grand General

02:13.960 --> 02:15.880
Envoy with credentials, bearer of the Yellow Axe

02:16.040 --> 02:17.880

02:18.040 --> 02:19.680
Granted the Nine Bestowments as special honor

02:19.760 --> 02:20.760
May enter court without hurrying

02:20.800 --> 02:21.880
Addressed without name

02:22.040 --> 02:23.200
May wear sword and shoes in court

02:23.320 --> 02:25.080
Opened a ministry equal to the Three Excellencies

02:31.360 --> 02:32.080
I

02:32.320 --> 02:34.040
Kowtow in gratitude for Your Majesty's grace
