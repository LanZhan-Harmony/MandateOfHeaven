WEBVTT

00:08.400 --> 00:09.640
The first year of Longwu

00:09.960 --> 00:11.240
You ascended the throne

00:11.720 --> 00:12.640
From then on

00:12.800 --> 00:13.320
Domestically

00:13.560 --> 00:15.280
You purged Prince Ning's remnants

00:15.280 --> 00:16.440
Stabilized the court

00:16.640 --> 00:17.760
Opened the borders

00:17.840 --> 00:19.320
Absorbed northern refugees

00:19.320 --> 00:20.320
Increased population

00:20.480 --> 00:21.640
Built strategic towns

00:21.680 --> 00:23.120
Sharpened weapons and fed horses

00:23.960 --> 00:24.480
Externally

00:24.680 --> 00:26.640
You sent envoys to former allies

00:26.960 --> 00:29.520
Repaired relations with the Murong clan of Yandong

00:30.320 --> 00:32.960
Though you constantly think of the northern expedition

00:33.120 --> 00:34.120
You deeply understand

00:34.200 --> 00:35.960
To achieve victory in one campaign

00:36.200 --> 00:39.080
This war requires thorough preparation

00:40.840 --> 00:41.920
For over ten years

00:42.080 --> 00:43.400
Xuan's foundation

00:43.400 --> 00:44.840
Under your rule

00:44.960 --> 00:46.080
Has gradually recovered

00:46.560 --> 00:47.280
Now

00:47.440 --> 00:49.320
The time is near

00:53.720 --> 00:55.000
The enemy cavalry is strong

00:55.280 --> 00:57.040
Direct engagement is unfavorable to us

00:57.440 --> 00:58.240
But fortunately

00:58.240 --> 01:00.720
Our Xuan territory has great strategic depth

01:01.320 --> 01:02.240
We should

01:02.280 --> 01:03.680
Avoid decisive battle with the enemy

01:03.840 --> 01:04.680
Let the enemy

01:04.920 --> 01:06.560
Penetrate deep into our heartland

01:07.560 --> 01:09.040
Once the Wuzhao penetrate deep

01:09.560 --> 01:10.760
We will along the way

01:10.840 --> 01:12.560
Implement scorched earth tactics

01:12.760 --> 01:14.120
Then send cavalry to raid

01:14.120 --> 01:15.200
Cut off Wuzhao supply lines

01:16.200 --> 01:17.840
Especially after the rainy season

01:18.000 --> 01:19.560
Newly formed river paths

01:19.560 --> 01:21.200
Can slow the enemy cavalry

01:21.640 --> 01:22.200
At the same time

01:22.280 --> 01:23.480
Our forces maneuver

01:23.560 --> 01:24.560
In guerrilla warfare

01:25.840 --> 01:26.760
In this way

01:27.000 --> 01:28.280
If we can eliminate in one stroke

01:28.280 --> 01:29.400
The enemy's effective forces

01:30.000 --> 01:30.840
Then the central plains

01:31.280 --> 01:32.200
Can be secured

01:32.680 --> 01:33.280
Second brother

01:34.680 --> 01:35.200
Not to mention

01:35.200 --> 01:36.760
How dangerous it is to let enemies cross Tianhe

01:37.560 --> 01:38.920
Your scorched earth strategy

01:39.200 --> 01:40.560
Will harm how many people?

01:41.000 --> 01:42.040
Even if we win

01:42.480 --> 01:43.560
You achieve success

01:43.680 --> 01:45.480
The dead will not be just ten thousand

01:46.120 --> 01:47.480
War always has casualties

01:47.680 --> 01:48.480
Today's brief pain

01:48.920 --> 01:49.840
For eternal peace

01:49.920 --> 01:50.760
Why not?

01:52.680 --> 01:53.760
Then, elder brother, you say

01:54.320 --> 01:54.840
This war

01:55.040 --> 01:56.120
How should it be fought?

01:57.400 --> 02:00.000
The key is to increase Xuan's overall strength

02:00.120 --> 02:01.480
I have a treatise on land

02:01.680 --> 02:03.280
A strategy I devised to strengthen the state

02:03.400 --> 02:04.680
Using Beiyuguan as a barrier

02:04.840 --> 02:06.320
Engage in attrition warfare with the Wuzhao

02:06.640 --> 02:08.160
The Wuzhao are good at fighting

02:08.560 --> 02:09.440
But poor at logistics

02:09.800 --> 02:10.680
And prone to infighting

02:11.120 --> 02:12.440
Fight a war of attrition with them

02:12.680 --> 02:14.400
Drag until their internal affairs collapse

02:14.800 --> 02:15.960
Supplies cut off

02:16.360 --> 02:17.520
Then the Wuzhao will surely be defeated

02:18.160 --> 02:19.000
This is

02:19.720 --> 02:20.560
Victory through governance

02:21.560 --> 02:23.160
Then you won't care about the people in the north?

02:25.360 --> 02:27.280
All things have priorities

02:27.680 --> 02:29.520
Choose the important and do it first

02:30.120 --> 02:31.960
This is the principle Father taught us since childhood

02:35.840 --> 02:36.680
Well said
